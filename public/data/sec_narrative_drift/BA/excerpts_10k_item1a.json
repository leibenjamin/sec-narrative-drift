Levels of U.S. defense spending in future periods are very difficult to predict and subject to significant risks. In addition, significant budgetary delays and constraints have already resulted in reduced spending levels, and additional reductions may be forthcoming. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act (The Act) established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $490 billion between the 2012 and 2021 U.S. government fiscal years. The Act also provided that the defense budget would face \u201csequestration\u201d cuts of up to an additional $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded. The impact of sequestration cuts has been reduced with respect to FY2016 and FY2017 following the enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 in November 2015. However, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure, including risk of future sequestration cuts."

Non-U.S. civil aviation authorities have issued directives to the same effect. Deliveries of the 737 MAX have been suspended until clearance is granted by the appropriate regulatory authorities. The grounding has reduced revenues, operating margins, and cash flows, and will continue to do so until production and deliveries resume and production rates return to pre-grounding levels. In connection with the effort to return the 737 MAX to service, we have developed software updates for the 737 MAX, together with an associated pilot training and supplementary education program. We continue to work with the FAA and other non-U.S. civil aviation authorities to complete remaining steps toward certification and readiness for return to service, including addressing their questions on the software updates and how pilots will interact with the airplane controls and displays in different flight scenarios. Any delays in certification and/or the resumption of deliveries or other liabilities associated with the accidents or grounding could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. In addition, multiple legal actions have been filed against us related to the 737 MAX. We also are fully cooperating with U.S. government investigations related to the accidents and the 737 MAX, including investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The FAA and other non-U.S. civil aviation authorities will determine the timing and conditions of return to service in each relevant jurisdiction. We have assumed that regulatory approval will enable 737 MAX deliveries to resume during mid-2020. This assumption reflects our best estimate at this time based on factors such as the estimated duration of regulatory approval and final pilot training requirements. In the event of unanticipated additional training requirements in one or more jurisdictions, delays in regulatory approval, and/or delays in our ability to resume deliveries, we may be required to take actions with longer-term impact, such as further changes to our production plans, employment reductions and/or the expenditure of significant resources to support our supply chain and/or customers."

During the fourth quarter of 2019, we announced plans to temporarily suspend 737 MAX production beginning in January 2020. Impacts related to the reduction in production rate followed by the production suspension have significantly increased costs to produce aircraft included in the current accounting quantity and will result in reduced 737 program and overall BCA segment operating margins when deliveries resume. We have also made significant assumptions regarding estimated costs expected to be incurred in 2020 and 2021 that should be included in program inventory and those estimated costs that will be expensed when incurred as abnormal production costs. If we are unable to return the 737 MAX aircraft to service in one or more jurisdictions or begin deliveries to customers on the schedule and/or at a pace consistent with our current expectations, we will incur significant additional costs and/or delay the resumption and subsequent ramp-up of 737 production. These delays would also result in significant additional disruption to the 737 production system once production resumes and would further delay efforts to restore and/or implement previously planned increases in the 737 production rate. Cash flows continue to be negatively impacted by delayed payments from customers, higher costs and inventory levels, and payments made to customers in connection with disruption to their operations. In addition, we have experienced claims and assertions from customers in connection with the grounding, and we recorded an earnings charge of\n$8,259 million\n, net of insurance recoveries of $500 million, in 2019, in connection with an estimate of potential concessions and other considerations to customers for disruptions related to the grounding and associated delivery delays."

The consolidated spending bills signed into law in September 2018 provide defense funding for FY19. However, other departments and agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), are being temporarily funded at FY18 levels. Failure to enact a Continuing Resolution or FY19 appropriations by February 15, 2019 would result in a partial government shutdown affecting these departments and agencies. Such a shutdown could impact the Company\u2019s operations. In addition, reduced discretionary spending limits initially enacted in 2011 would take effect again in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20 and FY21) unless Congress acts to raise the spending caps or to repeal or suspend the law establishing the reduced limits. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to pressure."

While fixed-price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, during 2018, we recorded reach-forward losses totaling\n$736 million\non the\nUSAF KC-46A Tanker\ncontract primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated with certification, testing and change incorporation on aircraft, as well as higher than expected effort to meet customer requirements in order to support delivery of the initial aircraft. In addition, in 2018, in connection with winning the T-X and MQ-25 Stingray competitions, we recorded a loss of $400 million associated with options for 346 T-X Trainer aircraft and a loss of $291 million related to the MQ-25 Stingray Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance."

During the fourth quarter of 2019, we announced plans to temporarily suspend 737 MAX production beginning in January 2020. Impacts related to the reduction in production rate followed by the production suspension have significantly increased costs to produce aircraft included in the current accounting quantity and will result in reduced 737 program and overall BCA segment operating margins when deliveries resume. We have also made significant assumptions regarding estimated costs expected to be incurred in 2020 and 2021 that should be included in program inventory and those estimated costs that will be expensed when incurred as abnormal production costs. If we are unable to return the 737 MAX aircraft to service in one or more jurisdictions or begin deliveries to customers on the schedule and/or at a pace consistent with our current expectations, we will incur significant additional costs and/or delay the resumption and subsequent ramp-up of 737 production. These delays would also result in significant additional disruption to the 737 production system once production resumes and would further delay efforts to restore and/or implement previously planned increases in the 737 production rate. Cash flows continue to be negatively impacted by delayed payments from customers, higher costs and inventory levels, and payments made to customers in connection with disruption to their operations.

The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and the 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act (ACSAA). One of these, section 116 of the ACSAA prohibited the FAA from issuing a type certificate to aircraft after December 27, 2022 unless the aircraft\u2019s flight crew alerting system met certain specifications. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 amended Section 116 of the ACSAA, such that applications for original or amended type certifications that were submitted to the FAA prior to December 27, 2020, including those of the 737-7 and 737-10, are no longer subject to the crew alerting specifications of Section 116. Additionally, beginning one year after the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737-10, any new 737 MAX aircraft must include certain safety enhancements to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in Boeing\u2019s application for the certification for the 737-10, and the sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning three years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737-10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety enhancements. As the holder of the type certificate, Boeing is required to bear any costs of these safety enhancement retrofits. We have provisioned for the estimated costs associated with the safety enhancements and do not expect those costs to be material. If we experience delays in achieving certification and/or incorporating safety enhancements, future revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Comparable agencies in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or similar regulatory agencies outside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional compliance costs. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, certification and production schedules."

In addition, multiple legal actions have been filed against us related to the 737 MAX. We also are fully cooperating with U.S. government investigations related to the accidents and the 737 MAX, including an ongoing investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also remain subject to compliance with a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice relating to the Department of Justice\u2019s investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the FAA. We expensed $744 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. Any further adverse impacts related to any such litigation or investigations could have a further material impact on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows."

We had not previously experienced a complete suspension of our operations at these production sites. While we have resumed operations at all of our production sites, we cannot predict whether or where further production disruptions could be required or what the ongoing impact of COVID-19-related operating restrictions will be. For example, we continue to experience near-term production disruptions and inefficiencies as well as additional operating costs due to social distancing requirements, increased levels of employee absenteeism and other factors related to COVID-19 restrictions. We cannot predict the impact that future production disruptions may have on our business, operations, financial performance and financial condition. We continue to monitor federal, state and municipal health authorities for new or modified guidance and requirements concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, and we may be required to impose additional operational restrictions and/or suspend operations at key production sites based on these requirements and recommendations and/or workplace disruptions caused by COVID-19. If future vaccination mandates or other similar governmental requirements take effect, or if COVID-19 case rates worsen at one or more of our production facilities, we may face further increases in employee absenteeism and/or attrition, any of which could cause operational disruptions and otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations."

The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the implementation of the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and the 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act, among them changing the process for certification of commercial aircraft. Comparable agencies that regulate similar matters in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or other similar regulatory agencies outside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional costs to achieve compliance. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. The 737 program experienced significant disruption due to the grounding of the 737 MAX and associated suspension of commercial operations of the 737 MAX aircraft by civil aviation authorities around the globe. 737 MAX deliveries resumed in late 2020 and early 2021 upon approval of the FAA and other non-U.S. civil aviation authorities. During 2020 and 2021, we experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries, including a pause in 787 deliveries since May 2021. During 2021, this resulted in reprioritizing production resources to support inspections and rework. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on undelivered 787 aircraft and engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding required actions for resuming delivery. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries as well as rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date. The regulators will ultimately determine the timing and conditions for resuming 787 deliveries. Delays on the 737 MAX, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers having the right to terminate orders and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft."

The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and the 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act (ACSAA). One of these, section 116 of the ACSAA prohibited the FAA from issuing a type certificate to aircraft after December 27, 2022 unless the aircraft\u2019s flight crew alerting system met certain specifications. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 amended Section 116 of the ACSAA, such that applications for original or amended type certifications that were submitted to the FAA prior to December 27, 2020, including those of the 737-7 and 737-10, are no longer subject to the crew alerting specifications of Section 116. Additionally, beginning one year after the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737-10, any new 737 MAX aircraft must include certain safety enhancements to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in Boeing\u2019s application for the certification for the 737-10, and the sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning three years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737-10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety enhancements. As the holder of the type certificate, Boeing is required to bear any costs of these safety enhancement retrofits. We have provisioned for the estimated costs associated with the safety enhancements and do not expect those costs to be material. If we experience delays in achieving certification and/or incorporating safety enhancements, future revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Comparable agencies in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or similar regulatory agencies outside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional compliance costs.

Dividends accumulate at a rate per annum equal to 6.00% on the liquidation preference thereof, which is $1,000.00 per share, payable when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. The dividends, if declared, can be paid in cash, or subject to certain limitations, in shares of our common stock, or a combination of both. Any unpaid dividends will continue to accumulate.

If we require additional capital to support our operations, pay off existing debt, address impacts to our business related to market developments, fund dividend payments or outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, reduce or delay capital investments, or issue equity, equity-linked or debt securities, and these activities could have terms that are unfavorable or could be dilutive.
