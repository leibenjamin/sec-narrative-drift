          "text": "The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, display, processing, transmission and security of personal information by companies offering online services have recently come under increased public scrutiny. The U.S. government, including the White House, the FTC and the U.S. Department of Commerce, are reviewing the need for greater regulation of the collection and use of information concerning consumer behavior with respect to online services, including regulation aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices. The FTC in particular has approved consent decrees resolving complaints and their resulting investigations into the privacy and security practices of a number of online, social media companies. Similar actions may also impact us directly, particularly because high school students who use our Writing Tools, College Admissions, College Counseling and Scholarship Services are typically under the age of 18, which subjects our business to laws covering the protection of minors. For example, various U.S. and international laws restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. The FTC has also revised the rules under the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act effective July 1, 2013. Although our services are not primarily directed to children under 13, our Chegg Writing Tools, in particular, could be used by students as early as in middle school, and the FTC could decide that our site now or in the future has taken inadequate precautions to prevent children under 13 from accessing our site and providing us information."

Many companies, including various \u201cnon-practicing entities\u201d or \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d are devoting significant resources to developing or acquiring patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the Internet. We have not exhaustively searched patents related to our technology. In addition, the publishing industry has been, and we expect in the future will continue to be, the target of counterfeiting and piracy. We have in the past and may continue to receive communications alleging that physical textbooks sold or rented by us are counterfeit. For example, we recently cooperated, and continue to cooperate, with a group of publishers in a series of audits which have identified several thousand potentially fraudulent textbooks which we have removed from our inventory. While our fulfillment partner, Ingram, has a system for inspecting the physical textbooks in our catalog of books, many of the books sold or rented to students are shipped directly from our suppliers, and, despite this inspection, unauthorized or counterfeit textbooks may inadvertently be included in the catalog of books we offer and may be subsequently sold or rented by us to students, or purchased by us through our buyback program, including on behalf of other buyers participating in our buyback program, and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability. We may implement measures in an effort to protect against these potential liabilities that could require us to spend substantial resources. Any costs incurred as a result of liability or asserted liability relating to sales of unauthorized or counterfeit textbooks could harm our business, reputation and financial condition."

Print textbook rental is highly capital intensive and presents both business planning and logistical challenges that are complex. To reduce our investment in the highly capital intensive nature of print textbook rentals, we have entered into a partnership with Ingram wherein Ingram makes all new investments in the rental library of print textbooks, taking title and risk of loss for the books, and provides logistical and fulfillment services for the print textbooks that we rent and sell. The partnership allows us to market, use our branding and maintain the customer experience around print textbook rentals, while reducing our investments in textbook inventory, fulfillment and logistics operations. As a result of this change, we stopped making additional investments in our textbook library beginning in May 2015 and we expect to rent and liquidate our remaining inventory of print textbooks during 2016. We expect the transition of these aspects of our print textbook offerings to Ingram to be complete by 2017. Our partnership with Ingram is non-exclusive and subject to"

Should the COVID-19 pandemic continue, colleges may face reduced enrollment and reduced income. Further, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to limit the functionality of colleges and universities, they may not have the financial resources to withstand prolonged declines in enrollment, diminishing revenues and even potential shutdowns and may be forced to close. Additionally, uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have forced colleges to pay heightened attention to alternative methods of instruction, including online learning and related concerns, such as proctoring exams. This increase in attention and demand may lead to additional scrutiny from the faculty of more traditional institutions, such as colleges or universities."

If the market and demand for a comprehensive learning platform does not develop as we expect, or if we fail to address the needs of this market, our business and prospects would be harmed. We face risks, expenses, and difficulties related to our specific business model, including the risks more fully described throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, which impede our ability to successfully accomplish the following, among other items:"

You should not rely on our revenue for any previous quarterly or annual period as any indication of our revenue or revenue growth in future periods. As we grow our business, we expect our revenue growth rates to decline compared to prior years or turn negative for a number of reasons, which may include more challenging comparisons to prior periods as our revenue grows, lower revenues from print textbooks as a result of our partnership with GT Marketplace, LLC (GT) beginning in April 2022, slowing demand for our platform or offerings, increasing competition, increasing regulation, lower enrollment in higher education, a decrease in the growth of our overall market or market saturation, and our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. In addition, our growth rates are likely to experience increased volatility, and may decline or turn negative, as the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and societal and economic circumstances shift."

There can be no assurance that any restructuring activities that we have undertaken or undertake in the future will achieve the cost savings, operating efficiencies, or other benefits that we may initially expect. In addition, restructuring activities has in the past and may continue to result in loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, attrition beyond our intended reduction in force, or a negative impact on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees. Internal restructurings can also require a significant amount of time and focus from management and other employees, which may divert attention from commercial operations. If any internal restructuring activities we have undertaken or undertake in the future fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected."

In particular, Google's roll out of Artificial Intelligence Overview (AIO) has created and is expected to continue to create headwinds for our industry and our business, most notably reductions in traffic to our website and customers subscribing to our services. In August 2024, Google began to significantly expand its AIO search experience, which displays AI-generated content at the top of its search results. This experience, which includes questions and solutions for education, keeps users on Google search results versus leading them onto our site. AIO\u2019s prevalence has grown and may continue to increase. While we continue to study the changes and adjust our SEO strategy, we expect Google may continue its shift from being a search origination point to the destination, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. As described in more detail in Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on February 24, 2025, we filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Google LLC and Alphabet Inc. (\"Google\"), asserting federal antitrust claims and common-law unjust enrichment claims, in connection with Google's expansion of its AIO search experience. Given the nature of the case, including that the proceedings are in their early stages, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of the case or whether Google will seek to counterclaim, or the likelihood of success should Google do so. This claim could result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, and divert significant resources. See \u201c\u2014 Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we are or may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.\n\""

(Case No. 22-cv-6986-JD) was filed in November 2022 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint was filed by a purported Chegg user and alleges various claims based on Chegg\u2019s failure to take reasonable security measures. The plaintiff asserts claims under negligence; negligence per se; the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1750, et seq.; the California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1798.150; and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201, et seq. The Plaintiff seeks relief that certifies a class, damages, a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On August 15, 2023, the Company received an order granting its motion to compel arbitration, and the case will be stayed and administratively closed pending the conclusion of arbitration."

The complaint was filed by a purported Chegg stockholder and alleged claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, as amended, based on allegedly misleading statements regarding our security measures to protect users\u2019 data and related internal controls and procedures, as well as our second quarter 2018 financial results. This case was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice in March 2019. Moreover, following the 2018 Data Incident, we received notices that an aggregate of 16,691 arbitration demands were filed against us by individuals alleging that they had suffered damages in connection with the 2018 Data Incident. All such arbitral demands have been resolved."

New competition may come from companies with greater brand recognition, and have significantly greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. We may, in the future, establish alliances or relationships with other competitors or potential competitors. To the extent such alliances are terminated or new alliances and relationships are established, our business could be harmed."
