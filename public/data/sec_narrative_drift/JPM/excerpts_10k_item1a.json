Under the arrangements contemplated by the Firm\u2019s Resolution Plan, JPMorgan Chase & Co. has established a new intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the \u201cIHC\u201d), and has contributed to the IHC the stock of substantially all of its direct subsidiaries (other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) as well as other assets and intercompany indebtedness owing to it. Under these arrangements, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received by it from securities issuances (including, without limitation, issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). As a result of these arrangements, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s ability to pay interest on its debt securities and dividends on its equity securities, to redeem or repurchase its outstanding securities and to fulfill its other payment obligations is dependent on it receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC.

These regulatory restrictions and limitations on the payments that JPMorgan Chase & Co. is permitted to receive from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC could reduce or hinder its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations, or result in JPMorgan Chase & Co. seeking protection under bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than"

In August 2014, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC announced the completion of their reviews of the second round of Title I resolution plans submitted by eleven large, complex banking organizations in 2013, including the Firm. The agencies jointly identified specific shortcomings with the 2013 resolution plans, including the Firm\u2019s 2013 plan. The FDIC\u2019s board of directors determined under Title I that the 2013 resolution plans, including the Firm\u2019s 2013 plan, were not credible and did not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Federal Reserve Board determined that the eleven banking organizations must take immediate actions to improve their resolvability and reflect those improvements in their 2015 plans. The Firm has devoted significant resources to its resolution planning efforts, and believes that in its most recent Title I resolution plan submitted to the Federal Reserve and FDIC in July 2015, it has addressed, or has made substantial progress in addressing, each of the shortcomings previously identified by the agencies."
