          "text": "Bank of America Corporation, our parent holding company, is required annually to submit a plan to the FDIC and Federal Reserve, describing its resolution strategy under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress or failure. In the current plan, Bank of America Corporation's preferred resolution strategy is a single point of entry strategy. This strategy provides that only the parent holding company files for resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and contemplates providing certain key operating subsidiaries with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress and to enable such subsidiaries to continue operating or be wound down in a solvent manner following a bankruptcy. Bank of America Corporation and key subsidiaries have entered into intercompany arrangements governing the contribution of capital and liquidity. As part of these arrangements, Bank of America Corporation transferred certain of its assets (and has agreed to transfer additional assets) to a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary in exchange for a subordinated note. Certain remaining assets secure ongoing obligations under these intercompany arrangements. The wholly-owned holding company subsidiary has also provided a committed line of credit which, in addition to cash, dividends and interest payments, including interest payments received in respect of the subordinated note, may be used to fund its obligations. These intercompany arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit, forgive the subordinated note and require Bank of America Corporation to contribute its remaining financial assets to the wholly-owned holding company subsidiary if its projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution becomes imminent, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and ability to meet our payment obligations."

The rule will be effective January 1, 2019 and U.S. G-SIBs, including Bank of America, will be required to maintain a minimum external TLAC. We estimate our minimum required external TLAC would be the greater of 22.5 percent of risk-weighted assets or 9.5 percent of SLR leverage exposure. In addition, U.S. G-SIBS must meet a minimum long-term debt requirement. Our minimum required long-term debt is estimated to be the greater of 8.5 percent of risk-weighted assets or 4.5 percent of SLR leverage exposure. Actions required to comply with the minimum external TLAC requirement by January 1, 2019 could impact our cost of funding and liquidity risk management plans."

We evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis. Legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal, contractual and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another, including the parent company. The parent company depends on dividends, distributions, loans, advances and other payments from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our common stock and preferred stock and to fund all payments on our other obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments, or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries. Our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses. Intercompany arrangements we entered into in connection with our resolution planning submissions could restrict the amount of funding available to the Corporation from our subsidiaries in certain severely adverse liquidity scenarios. For more information regarding our resolution plan, see Item 1A. Risk Factors \u2013 Other on page 15 ."

As proposed, the TLAC Rules would disqualify from TLAC eligible long-term debt, among other instruments, debt securities that permit acceleration for reasons other than insolvency or payment default, as well as debt securities defined as structured notes in the TLAC Rules and debt securities not governed by U.S. law. Our currently outstanding senior long-term debt typically permits acceleration for reasons other than insolvency or payment default and, as a result, neither such outstanding senior long-term debt nor any subsequently issued senior long-term debt with similar terms would qualify as TLAC eligible long-term debt under the proposed rules. We may need to take action to comply with the final TLAC Rules depending in substantial part on the ultimate eligibility requirements for senior long-term debt and any grandfathering provisions, including actions to conform or replace our existing debt securities."

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires the Banks to periodically disclose Bank of America\u2019s privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. Other laws and regulations, at the international, federal and state level, impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act also requires the Banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. These security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of personal and confidential information are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations. The October 6, 2015 ruling by the European Court of Justice that the U.S. EU Safe Harbor is invalid has impacted the ability of certain vendors who relied upon the Safe Harbor to provide services to us. While an EU-U.S. Privacy Shield agreement to replace the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor has been announced, the timing of adoption and implementation is uncertain. We also expect the EU to adopt a Data Protection Regulation, which will replace the existing EU Data Protection Directive. The impacts of the anticipated EU Data Protection Regulation are uncertain at this time."

In addition to customers and clients, the third parties with whom we interact and upon whom we rely include financial counterparties; financial intermediaries such as clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses; vendors; regulators; providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power, and retailers for whom we process transactions. Each of these third parties faces the risk of cyber attack, information breach or loss, or technology failure. Any such cyber attack, information breach or loss, or technology failure of a third party could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses. As a result of financial entities and technology systems becoming more interdependent and complex, a cyber incident, information breach or loss, or technology failure that significantly degrades, deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including the Corporation. For example, in recent years, there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses and increased interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses. This consolidation and interconnectivity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate complex systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any such cyber attack, information breach or loss, failure, termination or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses."

This announcement, in conjunction with financial benchmark reforms more generally and changes in the interbank lending markets have resulted in uncertainty about the future of LIBOR and certain other rates or indices which are used as interest rate \u201cbenchmarks.\u201d These actions and uncertainties may have the effect of triggering future changes in the rules or methodologies used to calculate benchmarks or lead to the discontinuance or unavailability of benchmarks. ICE Benchmark Administration is the administrator of LIBOR and maintains a reference panel of contributor banks, which includes Bank of America, N.A., London branch for certain LIBOR rates. Uncertainty as to the nature and effect of such reforms and actions, and the potential or actual discontinuance of benchmark quotes, may adversely affect the value of, return on and trading market for our financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to benchmarks, including any LIBOR-based securities, loans and derivatives, or our financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that we and other market participants will be adequately prepared for an actual discontinuation of benchmarks, including LIBOR, that may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics (including, but not limited to, interest rates to be paid to or by us) and cause significant disruption to financial markets that are relevant to our business segments, particularly Global Banking and Global Markets , among other adverse consequences, which may also result in adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations."

If a trigger is satisfied, our products and contracts may give the calculation agent (which may be us) discretion over the successor rate to be selected. The considerable uncertainty as to how the financial services industry will address the discontinuation of IBORs and/or such IBORs ceasing to be acceptable reference rates in financial instruments could ultimately result in client disputes and litigation surrounding the proper interpretation of our IBOR-based products and contracts. Accordingly, uncertainty regarding ARRs may continue to impact our business, operations and financial condition repeatedly and indefinitely."

The standard replaces the existing measurement of the allowance for credit losses, which is based on management\u2019s best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Corporation\u2019s lending activities, with management\u2019s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Corporation\u2019s financial assets that are recognized at amortized cost. The standard will also expand credit quality disclosures. The impact of this new accounting standard may be an increase in the Corporation\u2019s allowance for credit losses at the date of adoption which would result in a negative adjustment to retained earnings. The ultimate impact will depend on the characteristics of the Corporation\u2019s portfolio at adoption date as well as the macroeconomic conditions and forecasts as of that date.

Additionally, we could experience the loss of customers and business opportunities, the withdrawal of customer deposits, the misappropriation, alteration or destruction of our or our third parties\u2019 intellectual property or confidential information, the unauthorized access to or temporary or permanent loss or theft of personally identifiable information, including of our employees and customers, significant lost revenue, losses and claims brought by third parties, violations of applicable privacy, cybersecurity and other laws, rules and regulations, litigation exposure, economic sanctions, enforcement actions, government fines, penalties or intervention and other negative consequences. Although we maintain cyber insurance, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate. In addition, in the case of any cybersecurity incident, information or security breach or technology failure arising from third-party systems impacting us, any third-party indemnification may not be applicable or sufficient to address the impact of such cybersecurity incidents, information or security breaches or technology failures, including monetary losses of the Corporation. The occurrence of any of the events described above could adversely impact our businesses, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm, whether such events are actual or perceived."

Some outstanding IBOR Products are particularly challenging to modify due to the requirement that all impacted parties consent to such modification. To address outstanding IBOR Products that are difficult to modify, legislation has been adopted in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions. Litigation, disputes or other action may occur as a result of the interpretation or application of legislation or regulations, including if there is an overlap between laws or regulations in different jurisdictions or from interactions with any FCA-compelled \u201csynthetic\u201d LIBOR settings."

Banking regulators in the U.S. and globally have maintained heightened regulatory scrutiny and intensified supervisory focus on financial institution LIBOR transition plans, preparations and readiness, including our use of credit-sensitive rates like the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index and ARR-based term rates, which could result in regulatory action, litigation and/or the need to change the products offered by our businesses. Failure to meet industry-wide IBOR transition milestones and to cease issuance of IBOR Products by relevant cessation dates may, subject to certain regulatory exceptions, result in supervisory enforcement by applicable regulators, increase our cost of, and access to, capital or lead to other consequences."

During 2023, we sold approximately $3.1 billion of loans to GSEs, primarily Freddie Mac (FHLMC). FHLMC and Fannie Mae (FNMA) are currently in conservatorship, with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) acting as conservator. In 2019, the Treasury Department published a proposal to recapitalize FHLMC and FNMA and remove them from conservatorship and reduce their role in the marketplace. In January 2021, the Treasury Department further amended the agreement that governs the conservatorship of FHLMC and FNMA and delineated the continued objective to remove the GSEs from conservatorship. However, we cannot predict the future prospects of the GSEs, timing of the recapitalization or release from conservatorship, or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of the GSEs in the housing market. If the GSEs take a reduced role in the marketplace, including by limiting the mortgage products they offer, we could be required to seek alternative funding sources, retain additional loans on our balance sheet, secure funding through the Federal Home Loan Bank system, or securitize the loans through Private Label Securitization, which could increase our cost of funds related to the origination of new mortgage loans, increase credit risk and/or impact our capacity to originate new mortgage loans. Uncertainty regarding their future and the MBS they guarantee continues to exist for the foreseeable future. These developments could adversely affect our securities portfolios, capital levels, liquidity and results of operations."
