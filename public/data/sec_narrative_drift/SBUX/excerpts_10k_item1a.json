Our information technology systems also contain Starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans, product development initiatives and designs. Similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we have experienced frequent attempts to compromise our information technology systems. To the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third party\u2019s information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use or destruction of customers' or employees' data or that of the Company stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans. Such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. For example, the European Union adopted a new regulation that becomes effective in May 2018, called the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. Our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly respond to these incidents. Such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability."

Any report linking us to the use of unclean water, food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination, mislabeling or other food or beverage-safety issues could damage our brand value and severely hurt sales of our food and beverage products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or damages.

If customers become ill from food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination, mislabeling or other food or beverage-safety issues, we could be forced to temporarily close some stores and/or supply chain facilities, as well as recall products. In addition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could, by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general, adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, product recalls or food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, could materially harm our business and results of operations."

Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors in our international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. Increased competition in the U.S. packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the Channel Development segment.

Our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production, distribution, administration and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability, integrity and capacity of these systems. We also rely on third party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. Additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. Although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. Such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third party software or services, errors by our employees or third party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. If our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results."

Additionally, our Channel Development business is also in part dependent on the level of support our retail business partners provide our products, and in some markets there are only a few retailers.

Our customers may have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or trade down to Starbucks or competitors' lower priced products as a result of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, increased fuel and energy costs, higher interest rates, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, economic uncertainty and potential negative impacts relating to federal economic policy changes and recent international trade disputes. These factors may also result in a general downturn in the restaurant industry. Decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance as reduced revenues without a corresponding decrease in expenses result in sales de-leveraging, which creates downward pressure on margins and also negatively impacts comparable store sales, net revenues, operating income and earnings per share. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis."

Moreover, certain of those regions, including parts of China and the United States, have suffered a COVID-19 relapse after reopening. If those regions fail to fully contain COVID-19, or if additional regions suffer multiple COVID-19 relapses, any of those markets may not recover quickly or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As a result, we may incur additional impairment charges to our inventory, store and corporate assets\u2014 and our ability to realize the benefits from deferred tax assets may become limited\u2014 any of which may have a significant or material impact on our financial results. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d), which among other things, provides employer payroll tax credits for wages paid to employees who are unable to work during the COVID-19 outbreak and options to defer payroll tax payments for a limited period.

Our customers may have or in the future have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch to Starbucks or competitors' lower-priced products as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, changes in federal economic policy and recent international trade disputes. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience a reduction and/or increased volatility in demand for our products, which may be caused by, among other things: store closures or modified operating hours and business model, reduced customer traffic due to illness, quarantine or government or self-imposed restrictions placed on our stores' operations and changes in consumer spending behaviors (e.g. continued practice of social distancing, decrease in consumer confidence in general macroeconomic conditions and a decrease in consumer discretionary spending). Decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry."

Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices.

While the number of partners represented by unions is not significant, if a significant portion of our employees were to become unionized, our labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by other requirements and expectations that could increase our costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility and disrupt our business. Additionally, our responses to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and have adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results. These responses could also expose us to legal risk, causing us to incur costs to defend legal and regulatory actions, potential penalties and restrictions or reputational harm."

These legal proceedings may involve claims brought by store partners, customers, government agencies, suppliers, shareholders, or others through private actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, or other litigation, including litigation on a class or collective basis on behalf of what can be a large group of potential claimants. These legal proceedings have involved, and in the future may involve, allegations of illegal, unfair, or inconsistent employment practices, including those governing wage and hour, employment of minors, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, and vacation and family leave laws; food-safety issues including food-borne illness, food contamination, and adverse health effects from consumption of our food products; data security or privacy breaches; customer discrimination; personal injury in our stores; marketing and advertising claims, including claims that our environmental and social program claims are misleading or inaccurate; infringement of patent, copyright, or other intellectual property rights; violation of the federal securities laws; workers\u2019 compensation; or other concerns. We are party to a number of pending lawsuits and governmental audits alleging violations of federal and state employment laws, including wage and hour claims, and we could be involved in similar or even more significant litigation and legal proceedings in the future. Even if the allegations against us in current or future legal matters are unfounded or we ultimately are held not liable, the costs to defend ourselves may be significant, and the litigation may subject us to substantial settlements, fines, penalties, or judgments against us and may divert management\u2019s attention away from operating our business, all of which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Litigation also may generate negative publicity, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are not liable, which could damage our reputation and adversely impact our sales as well as our relationships with our store partners and customers. See Note 16 , Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved."

Failure to meet our announced guidance or market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to our operational and financial results, shareholder returns, and expectations regarding the success of our Back to Starbucks plan and related guidance, whether due to our assumptions not being met or the impact of various risks and uncertainties, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock.

Unions have secured representation rights at hundreds of our more than 10,000 U.S. company-operated stores, with potentially more to follow, and Starbucks is engaged in collective bargaining for initial collective bargaining agreements for these stores. If we encounter difficulties negotiating collective bargaining agreements, are unsuccessful in those efforts, or obtain contracts with unfavorable terms, then we could incur additional costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility, and increase our operational complexity. These risks could also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs."

Public disclosures may be criticized for accuracy or completeness, and previously reported data may require future adjustments. Failure to meet targets or goals adopted in connection with our responsible business initiatives or otherwise respond to stakeholder expectations on these topics could harm our reputation, reduce customer loyalty, and adversely affect our financial performance. Inadequate progress on responsible business initiatives may also erode trust, trigger negative publicity, litigation, or boycotts, and expose us to civil or criminal liability. Objections from third parties or governments to these initiatives may result in reputational harm, administrative, legislative, or public backlash, or other adverse action, and could negatively impact our financial results or business performance. Such consequences could also result from actual or perceived changes to the scope or extent of our responsible business initiatives, or any discontinuation thereof. Objections may come both from those who believe these initiatives are overly ambitious or inappropriate, and from those who believe they are not ambitious enough. As focus on these issues from consumers, government actors, and other stakeholders intensifies, the risks described in this section may increase."

These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress and state legislatures, which in certain cases may be inconsistent with one another, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, regulators, customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders are focusing on environmental, social, and governance (commonly referred to as \u201cESG\u201d) matters and related disclosures and operational regulations. These changing rules, regulations, and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and collecting, measuring, and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult, and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC\u2019s climate-related reporting requirements and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies. For example, the European Union\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (\u201cCSRD\u201d), with different implementation dates depending on company size and geographic location, has established extensive ESG-related disclosure requirements based on the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, including certain assurance obligations. The standards used to identify and collect the information and data required pursuant to the CSRD are still developing and uncertain, and this lack of certainty could result in increased costs related to complying with our reporting obligations under the CSRD and could increase the risk of failing to comply with the CSRD."
