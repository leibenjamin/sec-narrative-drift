Interstate pipeline companies transport the natural gas to the Duke Energy Registrants' systems under firm service agreements that are designed to meet the requirements of their core markets. A significant disruption to interstate pipelines capacity or reduction in natural gas supply due to events including, but not limited to, operational failures or disruptions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, freeze off of natural gas wells, terrorist or cyberattacks or other acts of war or legislative or regulatory actions or requirements, including remediation related to integrity inspections, could reduce the normal interstate supply of natural gas and thereby reduce earnings. Moreover, if additional natural gas infrastructure, including, but not limited to, exploration and drilling rigs and platforms, processing and gathering systems, off-shore pipelines, interstate pipelines and storage, cannot be built at a pace that meets demand, then growth opportunities could be limited and earnings negatively impacted."

Although there is no federal climate change legislation, in 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement on climate change by which the signatories agreed to pursue efforts to limit the increase in the global average temperature by less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. If the United States honors the Paris accord, the EPA may adopt and implement regulations to further restrict emissions of GHGs. Increased regulation of GHG emissions could impose significant additional costs on the Duke Energy Registrants' operations, their suppliers and customers. Regulatory changes could also result in generation facilities to be retired early and result in stranded costs if Duke Energy is not able to fully recover the costs and investment in generation. At this time, the effect that climate change regulation may have in the future on Duke Energy's business, financial condition or results of operations is not able to be predicted."

State regulators have approved other margin stabilizing mechanisms that, for example, allow for recovery of margin losses associated with negotiated transactions designed to retain large volume customers that could use alternative fuels or that may otherwise directly access natural gas supply through their own connection to an interstate pipeline. If regulators decided to discontinue the Duke Energy Registrants' use of tariff mechanisms, it would negatively impact results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, regulatory authorities also review whether natural gas costs are prudent and can disallow the recovery of a portion of natural gas costs that the Duke Energy Registrants seek to recover from customers, which would adversely impact earnings."

In 2015, closure activities began at the four sites specified as high priority by the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act (Coal Ash Act) and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of large amounts of CCR materials to offsite locations for use as structural fill and to offsite or onsite lined landfills. At other sites, preliminary planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs. Coal Ash Act requires CCR surface impoundments in North Carolina to be closed, with the closure method based on a risk ranking classification determined by state regulators and the North Carolina Coal Ash Commission. Other than the high priority sites specifically delineated by Coal Ash Act, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) has issued either preliminary draft risk rankings or has yet to designate specific risk classifications. These proposed risk rankings remain subject to a public comment period, including public meetings, followed by a final risk ranking recommendation by the NCDEQ to the Coal Ash Commission, for the Coal Ash Commission\u2019s final approval. As the closure and CCR management work progresses, final risk ranking classifications of surface impoundments in North Carolina are delineated, and final closure plans are developed and approved at each site, the scope and complexity of work and the amount of CCR material could be greater than estimates and could, therefore, materially increase compliance expenditures and rate impacts."

Performance incentive mechanisms condition some portion of the respective utility's earnings on its performance on established measurable consumer, utility system, or public policy outcomes. Revenue decoupling mechanisms provide periodic rate adjustments to ensure actual revenues match allowed revenues for certain customer classes.

If regulators decided to discontinue the Duke Energy Registrants' use of tariff mechanisms or other mechanisms intended to stabilize utility margins, it would negatively impact results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

          "text": "The Duke Energy Registrants are subject to regulations under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state regulations and policies, including by FERC, NRC, EPA and various other federal agencies as well as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. Regulation affects almost every aspect of the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 businesses, including, among other things, their ability to: take fundamental business management actions; determine the terms and rates for services; make acquisitions; issue equity or debt securities; engage in transactions with other subsidiaries and affiliates; and pay dividends upstream to the Duke Energy Registrants. Changes to federal regulations are continuous and ongoing. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies, including tax incentives and credits, will not be changed in ways that result in material modifications of business models and objectives or affect returns on investment by restricting activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs, causing delays, or prohibiting them outright, which could have a material effect on the Duke Energy Registrants' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Such potential changes that may have adverse consequences could include no longer allowing tax incentives and credits currently provided for under the IRA, including the ability to record or sell related tax credits to third parties."

          "text": "The Duke Energy Registrants have recognized significant AROs related to these CCR-related requirements. Closure activities began in 2015 at the four sites specified as high priority by the Coal Ash Act and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of CCR materials to off-site locations for use as structural fill, to appropriately engineered off-site or on-site lined landfills or conversion of the ash for beneficial use. Duke Energy has completed excavation of coal ash at the four high-priority North Carolina sites. At other sites, planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs, and closure activities have commenced. As the closure and CCR management work progresses and final closure plans and corrective action measures are\ndeveloped and approved at each site, the scope and complexity of work and the amount of CCR material could be greater than estimates and could, therefore, materially increase compliance expenditures and rate impacts."

          "text": "During 2015, EPA regulations were enacted related to the management of CCR from power plants. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under the RCRA and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and, new and existing surface impoundments, and establish requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, as well as additional legal requirements that may be imposed in the future, such as the settlement reached with the NCDEQ to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina, and partially excavate the remaining two, and the EPA's January 11, 2022, issuance of a letter interpreting the CCR Rule, including its applicability and closure provisions. These federal and state laws, regulations and other legal requirements may require or result in additional expenditures, including increased operating and maintenance costs, which could affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. The Duke Energy Registrants will continue to seek full cost recovery for expenditures through the normal ratemaking process with state and federal utility commissions, who permit recovery in rates of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with the Duke Energy Registrants\u2019 regulated operations, and through other wholesale contracts with terms that contemplate recovery of such costs, although there is no guarantee of full cost\nrecovery. In addition, the timing for and amount of recovery of such costs could have a material adverse impact on Duke Energy's cash flows."

          "text": "Duke Energy\u2019s results of operations depend, in significant part, on the extent to which it can implement its business strategy successfully. Duke Energy's clean energy transition, which includes achieving net-zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2050, modernizing the regulatory construct, transforming the customer experience, and digital transformation, is subject to business, policy, regulatory, technology, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond its control and may make those goals difficult to achieve."
