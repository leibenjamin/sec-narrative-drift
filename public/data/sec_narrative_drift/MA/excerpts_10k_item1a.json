For example, the recent U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 represents a significant overhaul of the U.S. federal tax code. This tax legislation reduced the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate and made other changes that could have a favorable impact on our overall U.S. federal tax liability in a given period. However, the tax legislation also included a number of provisions that limit or eliminate various deductions, including interest expense, performance-based compensation for certain executives and the domestic production activities deduction, among others, that could affect our U.S. federal income tax position. We are continuing to evaluate the overall impact of this tax legislation on our operations and U.S. federal income tax position. See Note 17 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion of the TCJA. While we expect the TCJA to be favorable to the Company overall, there can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the U.S. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, our customers may sponsor (or we may certify as PCI-compliant) third-party processors to process transactions generated by cards carrying our brands and merchants may use third parties to provide services related to card use. A breach of the systems on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are processed, transmitted or stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving cards carrying our brands, damage our reputation and lead to claims against us, as well as subject us to regulatory actions. We routinely encounter account data compromise events, some of which have been high profile, involving merchants and third-party payment processors that process, store or transmit payment card data, which affect millions of Mastercard, Visa, Discover, American Express and other types of cardholders. These events typically involve external agents hacking the merchants\u2019 or third-party processors\u2019 systems and installing malware to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of those systems. Further data security breaches may subject us to reputational damage and/or lawsuits involving payment cards carrying our brands. Damage to our reputation or that of our brands resulting from an account data breach of either our systems or the systems of our customers, merchants and other third parties could decrease the use and acceptance of our cards and other payment devices, as well as the trend toward electronic payments, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our transaction volumes, results of operations and prospects for future growth, or increase our costs by leading to additional regulatory burdens being imposed upon us."

Cards that use magnetic-stripe technology, still widely used in the United States, continue to raise heightened vulnerabilities to fraud relative to other technologies due to the static nature of the information on the magnetic stripe. Fraud is also more likely to occur in transactions where the card is not present, such as online commerce, which constitutes an increasing percentage of transactions. In addition, as outsourcing and specialization become commonplace in the payments industry, there are more third parties involved in processing transactions using our cards. While we are taking measures to mitigate risks associated with magnetic stripes (via increased migration to EMV) and making digital payments more secure through MDES, increased fraud levels involving our cards, or misconduct or negligence by third parties processing or otherwise servicing our cards, could lead to regulatory intervention, such as enhanced security requirements, as well as damage to our reputation. These occurrences could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or increase our compliance costs, and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business."

          "text": "As our workforce composition continues to change, our employees may have different expectations with respect to flexibility and well-being support, and may have different career motivations (such as pursuing project-based work or other gig opportunities, as opposed to linear career paths). Additionally, employees may require different levels of support as to re-skilling and upskilling in order to adapt to advancements in our industry and changes in technology. Further, certain current and prospective employees may have expectations as to positions we take on environmental, social and governance matters. To the extent we are unable to effectively meet and/or balance these different expectations, motivations and needs, we could experience a negative impact to the quality of our corporate culture, the productivity of our workforce, our ability to innovate and our ability to attract and retain talent."

These matters include initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, help everyone participate equitably in the digital economy and create a workplace that provides equal opportunities for all of our employees. Consumers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on these impacts. To the extent any of our disclosures, public statements and metrics about these matters are subsequently viewed as inaccurate, or we are unable to execute on these initiatives, we may be viewed negatively by stakeholders concerned about these matters. Moreover, in recent years, we have received negative feedback from stakeholders on the adequacy of our environmental, social and governance initiatives. We have also increasingly been receiving negative feedback from anti-environmental, social and governance stakeholders in opposition to such initiatives. Stakeholders from both"

This expansion has amplified and may continue to amplify the impact of these various laws and regulations on our business or subject us to new laws and regulations. For example, our acquisition of Recorded Future, a global threat intelligence company, increases our exposure to certain laws and regulations, including global cybercrime and other laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. As a result, we are required to constantly monitor our data practices and potentially change them when necessary or appropriate. We also need to provide increased care in our data management, governance and quality practices, particularly as it relates to the use of data in products leveraging AI."

Our payment programs compete against competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry and compete in all payment categories, including paper-based payments and all forms of electronic payments. We compete against general purpose payments networks, debit and local networks, ACH and real-time account-based payments systems, digital wallets and other fintechs (focused on online activity across various channels and processing payments using in-house capabilities), government-backed networks and digital currencies. We also face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our value-added services and new adjacent network capabilities (including open banking and digital identity)."

However, future attacks or breaches could lead to security breaches of the networks, systems (including third-party provider systems) or devices that our customers use to access our products and services, which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary, sensitive and personal information (including account data information) or data security compromises. Such attacks or breaches could also cause service interruptions, malfunctions or other failures in the physical infrastructure, networks or operations systems that support our business and customers (such as the lack of availability of our value-added services), as well as the operations of our customers or other third parties. In addition, they could lead to damage to our reputation with our customers, other stakeholders and the broader payments ecosystem, additional costs to us (such as repairing systems, adding new personnel or protection technologies or compliance costs), regulatory penalties, financial losses to both us and our customers and partners and the loss of customers and business opportunities. These consequences could be further pronounced in jurisdictions in which we are deemed critical national infrastructure. If such attacks are not detected immediately, or disclosed as required by law, their effect could be compounded."
