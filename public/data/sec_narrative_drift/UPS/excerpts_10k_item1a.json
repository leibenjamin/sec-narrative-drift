These actions include whether the CSPF will submit a revised pension benefit reduction plan or otherwise seek federal government assistance, the extent to which benefits are paid by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, as well as the effect of discount rates and various other actuarial assumptions. Our best estimate, as of the measurement date of December 31, 2016, is that we do not have any liability for additional coordinating benefits of the UPS/IBT Plan. However, there are numerous uncertainties that exist regarding the ultimate resolution of the CSPF situation and the current projected benefit obligation could materially increase as these uncertainties are resolved\n."

In 2015, CSPF submitted a proposed pension suspension plan to the U.S. Department of Treasury under the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (\u201cMPRA\u201d) which proposes to make retirement benefit reductions to CSPF participants, including to the benefits of certain UPS employee participants. Separately, UPS agreed to provide supplemental benefits under the UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan to offset certain benefit reductions under the CSPF. We have no other multi-employer pension plans subject to such a funding obligation. UPS has reviewed the CSPF\u2019s proposed plan to evaluate the validity of the actions taken by the CSPF, the plan\u2019s compliance with the MPRA (and proposed regulations thereunder) and its potential impact on UPS\u2019s funding obligations under the UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan. We are vigorously challenging the proposed suspension plan because it does not fully comply with the law and we do not believe certain actions by CSPF are valid. Accordingly, we have not assumed or recognized a liability for supplemental benefits within the UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan due to the submission of CSPF\u2019s proposed plan to the U.S. Department of Treasury. Further, we are not able to estimate a range of additional obligations, if any, or determine whether any such amounts are material due to a number of uncertainties relating to the MPRA (and proposed regulations thereunder) and assumptions made by the CSPF in its proposed plan."

We require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risk associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. We mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through our indexed fuel surcharges and we may also enter into hedging transactions from time to time. If we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges, higher fuel costs could adversely impact our operating results. Even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharges, high fuel surcharges may result in a mix shift from our higher-yielding air products to lower-yielding ground products or an overall reduction in volume. If fuel prices rise sharply, even if we are successful in increasing our fuel surcharge, we could experience lag time in implementing the surcharge, which could adversely affect our short-term operating results. There can be no assurance that our hedging transactions will be effective to protect us from changes in fuel prices. Moreover, we could experience a disruption in energy supplies, including our supply of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, as a result of war, actions by producers, or other factors beyond our control, which could have an adverse effect on our business."

In future collective bargaining negotiations, we could agree to make significantly higher future contributions to improve the funded status of one or more of these plans. The funded status of these multiemployer plans is impacted by various factors, including investment performance, health care inflation, changes in demographics and changes in participant benefit levels. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could result from our participation in these plans."

We are negotiating in good faith in an effort to reach an agreement that is in the best interests of our employees, the Teamsters and UPS; however, no assurances of our ability to do so, or the timing or terms thereof, can be provided. Customers may reduce their business or stop doing business with us if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services. We may permanently lose customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service, and this could materially adversely affect us. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations. Furthermore, our actions or responses to any such negotiations, labor disputes, strikes or work stoppages could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and our corporate reputation and have adverse effects on our business, including our results of operations."

          "text": "We are subject to complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, security, labor, employment, safety, privacy, disclosure and data protection and other governmental laws, regulations and policies, both in the U.S. and internationally. In addition, we are impacted by laws, regulations and policies that affect global trade, including tariff and trade policies, export requirements, embargoes, sanctions, taxes, monetary policies and other restrictions and charges. Trade discussions and arrangements between the U.S. and various of its trading partners are fluid, and existing and future trade agreements are, and are expected to continue to be, subject to a number of uncertainties, including the imposition of new tariffs or adjustments and changes to the products covered by existing tariffs. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies or decisions or interpretations by authorities applying those laws and regulations, cannot be predicted. Compliance with any new laws, regulations or policies may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures. Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies in the U.S. or other countries could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could materially adversely affect us. For example, as previously disclosed, the SEC recently investigated our controls and practices surrounding impairment analyses in connection with the divestiture of UPS Freight in April 2021. On November 22, 2024, we entered into a settlement with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings in connection with alleged violations of Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 (and related provisions), resolving the investigation. Under the terms of the settlement, we agreed to pay a civil penalty, and agreed to remedial actions, training and process changes."

          "text": "International regulations also continue to increase and could materially increase our operating costs. For example, the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, a European regulation, mandates jet fuel suppliers in Europe supply a target percentage of sustainable aviation fuel (\u201cSAF\u201d) at airports inside the European Union. The SAF target percentage starts at 2% in 2025 and increases to 70% by 2050. The cost of SAF can be higher than conventional jet fuel, and these suppliers can pass this cost along to purchasers, which can increase our operating costs, potentially significantly. In addition, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (\"CORSIA\"), a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth began a voluntary pilot phase in 2021, with mandatory participation scheduled to begin in 2027. Details regarding implementation of CORSIA continue to develop, and compliance may increase our operating costs, potentially significantly."

In the first quarter of 2025, we entered into an agreement in principle with this customer that will provide for a reduction in their volume by more than 50% by June 2026. In connection therewith, we are making certain business and operational changes intended to match our workforce to our activity and eliminate our stranded costs. In the event we are not able to successfully reduce our costs in connection therewith, our profitability could be materially impacted. For additional information on the expected operational and financial impacts arising from this agreement, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d."

Customers may reduce shipments, supply chains may be disrupted, demand may be negatively impacted or our costs to operate our business may increase, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business. A potential result of climate change is more frequent or more severe weather events or natural disasters. To the extent such weather events or natural disasters do become more frequent or severe, disruptions to our business and those of our customers and costs to repair damaged facilities or maintain or resume operations could increase. Furthermore, climate change may reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance for these negative impacts of natural disasters and adverse weather conditions by contributing to an increase in the incidence and severity of such natural disasters."
