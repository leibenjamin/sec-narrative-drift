In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In addition, companies are developing biosimilars in other countries that could compete with AbbVie\u2019s biologic products. For example, the FDA has approved a biosimilar of HUMIRA in the United States and final approval of a biosimilar of HUMIRA in the EU is imminent, and Boehringer Ingelheim\u2019s marketing authorization application to the EMA and its application to the United States FDA have been accepted for review. As competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing AbbVie\u2019s biologic products, AbbVie\u2019s products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, with the attendant competitive pressure and consequences. Expiration or successful challenge of AbbVie\u2019s applicable patent rights could also trigger competition from other products, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. As a result, AbbVie could face more litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to its biologic products."

For example, HUMIRA competes with a number of anti-TNF products that are approved for a number of disease states and AbbVie's virology products compete with protease inhibitors and other anti-HIV treatments. These competitors may introduce new products or develop technological advances that compete with AbbVie's products in therapeutic areas such as immunology, virology/liver disease, oncology, dyslipidemia, and neuroscience. AbbVie cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction by competitors of new products or technological advances. Such competing products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than AbbVie's products, and this could negatively impact AbbVie's business and results of operations."

If any of the conditions to the Acquisition is not satisfied, it could delay or prevent the Acquisition from occurring, which could negatively impact AbbVie\u2019s share price and future business and financial results. Further, as a condition to their approval of the Acquisition, agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the AbbVie\u2019s business after the closing. These requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the consummation of the Acquisition or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction. In addition, changes in laws and regulations, including Irish legislation implementing a tax increase payable upon completion of the Acquisition, could adversely impact AbbVie\u2019s post-Acquisition profitability and financial results. Following the Acquisition, AbbVie may not realize the Acquisition\u2019s intended benefits within the expected timeframe or at all."

Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect AbbVie's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks related to AbbVie's business, risks related to AbbVie's proposed acquisition of Allergan (the \"Acquisition\") and the combined company upon completion of the Acquisition, and risks related to AbbVie's common stock. Based on the information currently known to it, AbbVie believes that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting it in each of these categories of risks. However, the risks and uncertainties AbbVie faces are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below and may not be in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to AbbVie or that AbbVie currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods."

In the United States, practices of managed care groups, and institutional and governmental purchasers, as well as federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, contribute to pricing pressures. In particular, the IRA will have the effect of reducing prices and reimbursements for certain of our products, which could significantly impact AbbVie\u2019s results of operations. Under the IRA, the U.S Department of Health and Human Services can effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these government prices can apply as soon as nine years (for small-molecule drugs) or 13 years (for biological products) from their FDA approval and will be capped at a statutory ceiling price that is likely to represent a significant discount from average prices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. In August 2023, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the CMS, selected Imbruvica as one of the first 10 medicines subject to government-set prices beginning in 2026. The price-setting process will conclude by August 1, 2024, and on September 1, 2024, the CMS will publish prices that will be applicable to the 10 drugs in the Medicare program beginning January 1, 2026. It is possible that more of our products, including products that generate substantial revenues, could be selected in future years, which could, among other things, accelerate revenue erosion prior to expiration of intellectual property protections. In addition, beginning in January 2025, under the IRA, the 70% coverage gap discount program will be replaced by a 10% manufacturer discount for all Medicare Part D beneficiaries that have met their deductible and incurred out of pocket drug costs below a $2,000 threshold and a 20% discount for beneficiaries that have incurred out of pocket drug costs above the $2,000 threshold under the new Part D benefit redesign. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties, which could be significant. The IRA has and will continue to meaningfully impact AbbVie\u2019s business strategies and those of others in the pharmaceutical industry. The full impact of the IRA on AbbVie\u2019s business and the pharmaceutical industry, including the implications to us of our or a competitor's product being selected for price setting, remains uncertain."
