Based on current legislation, available guidance and the June 28, 2025 G7 Pillar Two Statement committing to a side-by-side solution for U.S. parented groups, we do not anticipate the Pillar Two global minimum tax to have a material impact to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or effective tax rate.

The changes included in the U.S. Tax Act were broad and complex. Under the current U.S. presidential administration, comprehensive federal income tax reform has been proposed, including an increase in the U.S. Federal corporate income tax rate, elimination of certain investment incentives and an increase in U.S. taxation of non-U.S. earnings. While these proposals are controversial, likely to change during the legislative process and may prove difficult to enact as proposed in the current closely divided U.S. Congress, their impact could nonetheless be significant."
