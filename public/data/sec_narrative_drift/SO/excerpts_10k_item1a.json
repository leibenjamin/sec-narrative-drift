If Southern Company, any traditional electric operating company, Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, or Nicor Gas is not able to access capital at competitive rates or on favorable terms, its ability to implement its business plan will be limited by impacting its ability to fund capital investments or acquisitions that Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, or Nicor Gas may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows. In addition, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, and Nicor Gas rely on committed bank lending agreements as back-up liquidity which allows them to access low cost money markets. Each of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, and Nicor Gas believes that it will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current credit ratings. However, certain events or market disruptions may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to raise capital through the issuance of securities or other borrowing arrangements or the ability to secure committed bank lending agreements used as back-up sources of capital. Such disruptions could include:"

          "text": "There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas, including capital structure, regulatory environment, the ability to cover liquidity requirements, and other commitments for capital. Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, Southern Company Gas Capital, and Nicor Gas could experience a downgrade in their ratings if any rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk of the industry or Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas has deteriorated. Changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have a negative impact on credit ratings. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas, borrowing costs likely would increase, including automatic increases in interest rates under applicable term loans and credit facilities, the pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and, particularly for any downgrade to below investment grade, significant collateral requirements may be triggered in a number of contracts. Any credit rating downgrades could require a traditional electric operating company, Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, Southern Company Gas Capital, or Nicor Gas to alter the mix of debt financing currently used, and could require the issuance of secured indebtedness and/or indebtedness with additional restrictive covenants."

The Court reversed the 2013 MPSC Rate Order based on, among other things, its findings that (1) the rate treatment was not provided for under the Baseload Act and (2) the Mississippi PSC should have determined the prudence of Kemper IGCC costs before approving rate recovery through the 2013 MPSC Rate Order. The Court also found the 2013 Settlement Agreement unenforceable due to a lack of public notice for the related proceedings. On July 7, 2015, the Mississippi PSC ordered that the rates be terminated effective July 20, 2015 and required the fourth quarter 2015 refund of the $342 million collected under the 2013 MPSC Rate Order, along with associated carrying costs of $29 million."

The agreements with Denbury and Treetop provide Denbury and Treetop with termination rights as Mississippi Power has not satisfied its contractual obligation to deliver captured CO\n2\nby May 11, 2015. Since May 11, 2015, Mississippi Power has been engaged in ongoing discussions with its off-takers regarding the status of the CO\n2\ndelivery schedule as well as other issues related to the CO\n2\nagreements. As a result of discussions with Treetop, on August 3, 2015, Mississippi Power agreed to amend certain provisions of their agreement that do not affect pricing or minimum purchase quantities. Potential requirements imposed on CO\n2\noff-takers under the Clean Power Plan (if ultimately enacted in its current form, pending resolution of litigation) and the potential adverse financial impact of low oil prices on the off-takers increase the risk that the CO\n2\ncontracts may be terminated or materially modified. Any termination or material modification of these agreements could result in a material reduction in Mississippi Power\u2019s revenues to the extent Mississippi Power is not able to enter into other similar contractual arrangements. Additionally, if the contracts remain in place, sustained oil price reductions could result in significantly lower revenues than Mississippi Power forecasted to be available to offset customer rate impacts, which could have a material impact on Mississippi Power's financial statements."

Costs incurred through December 31, 2016 totaled $6.73 billion, net of the Initial and Additional DOE Grants. Of this total, $2.76 billion of costs has been recognized through income as a result of the $2.88 billion cost cap, $0.84 billion is included in retail and wholesale rates for the assets in service, and the remainder will be the subject of the 2017 Rate Case to be filed with the Mississippi PSC and expected subsequent wholesale Municipal and Rural Associations rate filing with the FERC. Mississippi Power continues to believe that all costs related to the Kemper IGCC have been prudently incurred in accordance with the requirements of the 2012 MPSC order confirming the CPCN originally approved by the Mississippi PSC in 2010 authorizing the acquisition, construction, and operation of the Kemper IGCC. Mississippi Power also recognizes significant areas of potential challenge during future regulatory proceedings (and any subsequent, related legal challenges) exist. As described further herein, these challenges include, but are not limited to, prudence issues associated with capital costs, financing costs (AFUDC), and future operating costs, net of chemical revenues; potential operating parameters; income tax issues; costs deferred as regulatory assets; and the 15% portion of the project previously contracted to SMEPA."

Mississippi Power also expects that timely resolution of the 2017 Rate Case will likely require a negotiated settlement agreement. In the event an agreement acceptable to both Mississippi Power and the MPUS (and other parties) can be negotiated and ultimately approved by the Mississippi PSC, it is reasonably possible that full regulatory recovery of all Kemper IGCC costs will not occur. The impact of such an agreement on Southern Company\u2019s and Mississippi Power\u2019s financial statements would depend on the method, amount, and type of cost recovery ultimately excluded. Certain costs, including operating costs, would be recorded to income in the period incurred, while other costs, including investment-related costs, would be charged to income when it is probable they will not be recovered and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. In the event an agreement acceptable to the parties cannot be reached, Mississippi Power intends to fully litigate its request for full recovery through the Mississippi PSC regulatory process and any subsequent legal challenges."

In connection with future VCM filings, Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate costs currently included in the construction contingency estimate for rate recovery as and when they are appropriately included in the base capital cost forecast. After considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of costs included in the construction contingency estimate since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in these future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded a total pre-tax charge to income of $1.1 billion ($0.8 billion after tax) in the second quarter 2018, which includes the total increase in the base capital cost forecast and construction contingency estimate."

While some jurisdictions, including some in the Southern Company system's service territory, have relaxed some of these restrictions, many of these restrictions remain and there is no guarantee restrictions will not be reimposed in the future. These restrictions have significantly disrupted economic activity in the service territories of the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities and caused volatility in capital markets at certain periods during 2020. For example, retail electric revenues have declined slightly compared to 2019, as discussed further in RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 \"Southern Company \u2013 Electricity Business\" in Item 7 herein. In addition, the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities temporarily suspended disconnections for non-payment by customers and waived late fees for certain periods. The effects of the continued COVID-19 pandemic and related global, federal, state, and local responses could include extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, further reduced labor availability and productivity, and a prolonged reduction in economic activity. These effects could have a variety of adverse impacts on the Registrants, including, but not limited to, continued reduced demand for energy, particularly from commercial and industrial customers, impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets, reductions in investments recorded at fair value, and further impairment of the ability of the Registrants to develop, construct, and operate facilities, including electric generation, transmission, and distribution assets, to perform necessary corporate and customer service functions, and to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets.

The delivery of components, materials, equipment, and other resources that are critical to the Southern Company system's operations has been impacted by domestic and global supply chain disruptions. Future pandemic health events or continued international tensions, including the ramifications of regional conflicts, such as those in Ukraine and the Middle East, could further exacerbate global supply chain disruptions. These disruptions and shortages could adversely impact business operations. The constraints in the supply chain also could restrict availability and delay construction, maintenance, or repair of items needed to support normal operations or to continue planned capital investments."

This process relies on information from internal and external sources, which may or may not be accurate in predicting future outcomes. Each year, the Southern Company system develops scenarios which look out over a 30-year horizon. In 2022, scenarios included a wide range of fuel prices, load growth, and CO\n2\nprices starting between $0 and $50 per metric ton of CO\n2\nemitted and escalating over the 30-year horizon."

The majority of this demand is driven by the power needs and projected power needs of data centers to serve an increasingly digital economy and to support artificial intelligence. Other demands are coming from new industrial facilities with advanced manufacturing processes for such products as electric vehicles and batteries. Ensuring that incremental revenues from these projected new demands cover incremental costs and risks will be critical to continuing the traditional electric operating companies' value proposition to customers. The new nature of these industries, additional capital spending needs, and uncertainties on the actual capacity required to satisfy the projected new demands of these new industries may impact the traditional electric operating companies."

The traditional electric operating companies from time to time have experienced and may continue to experience deficits in their storm cost recovery reserve balances. For example, in September 2024, Hurricane Helene caused significant damage to Georgia Power's transmission and distribution facilities. The incremental restoration costs related to this hurricane totaled approximately $870 million, of which approximately $750 million was deferred in the regulatory asset for storm damage, approximately $90 million was capitalized to property, plant, and equipment, and approximately $30 million was deferred as future billings to open access transmission tariff customers. Additionally, the applicable state PSC or other applicable state regulatory agency may deny or delay recovery of any portion of such costs."

However, the Registrants cannot guarantee that security efforts will have the maturity to detect or prevent breaches, operational incidents, or other breakdowns of technology systems and network infrastructure, especially in the event the Registrants are targeted by a sophisticated attacker with significant resources, such as a nation-state or state-sponsored actor. As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, new technologies and increased computing power could lead to new attack techniques and more sophisticated attacks. Further, the Registrants do not have security visibility into all operational technology communications and processes, do not maintain completely exhaustive inventories of assets and applications, and do not centrally manage or monitor all technologies, applications, and environments, which could negatively affect preparation for, investigation of, or response to an information security incident. Accordingly, the Registrants cannot provide any assurance that information security incidents will not have a material adverse effect in the future."

The counterparties to coal supply contracts may not fulfill their obligations to supply coal because of financial or technical problems. In addition, the suppliers and/or railroads may be delayed in supplying or delivering or may not be required to supply or deliver coal under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If the traditional electric operating companies are unable to obtain their contracted coal requirements, they may be required to purchase additional coal at higher prices or limit coal generation, and these increased costs may not be recoverable through rates if deemed to be imprudently incurred. Coal deliveries continued to be delayed early in 2023, which has largely been attributed to labor shortages in the railroad industry. Service levels improved over the course of 2023 and deliveries returned to normal levels by the end of 2023. As coal-fired generating facilities are retired, the demand for coal is expected to continue to decline. As a result, railroads may commit fewer resources to coal transportation, which could increase these risks."
