The counterparties to coal supply contracts may not fulfill their obligations to supply coal because of financial or technical problems. In addition, the suppliers may be delayed in supplying or may not be required to supply coal under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. If the traditional electric operating companies are unable to obtain their contracted coal requirements, they may be required to purchase their coal requirements at higher prices, and these increased costs may not be recoverable through rates. The railroad industry is experiencing labor shortages, which could lead to delays in coal deliveries or increased costs. Additionally, the utility industry is also being impacted by coal delivery challenges associated with new railroad management systems which favor stable, predictable deliveries and a market trend of shifting railroad capacity away from coal deliveries to other industries."
