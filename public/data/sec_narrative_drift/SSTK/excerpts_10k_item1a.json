Because our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value of the euro, British pound, Australian dollar and Japanese yen, and other currencies against the U.S. dollar have had and will continue to have a significant effect on our reported financial results. Exchange rates have been volatile in recent years and such volatility may persist due to economic and political circumstances, such as Brexit."

In\n2016\n, sales to customers in the United Kingdom accounted for approximately\n10%\nof our total revenue and sales to customers in Europe, including the United Kingdom, accounted for approximately\n33%\nof our total revenue. As a result of the Brexit vote, the United Kingdom is expected to initiate a process to leave the European Union and begin negotiating the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the European Union. At this time, it is uncertain what impact this process will have on the economy in Europe, including in the United Kingdom, as well as other countries. In addition, the terms and conditions of Brexit may have an impact on the value of the British pound or other European countries\u2019 currencies as compared to one another or as compared to the U.S. dollar. Adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation could have a negative impact on our results of operations or financial position. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, such as those related to data privacy, as the United Kingdom determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate."

The backbone network of the internet has been the target of such programs. The internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure, and it could face outages and delays in the future. These outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage generally as well as the level of usage of our services, which could adversely impact our business."

Prior to the amendment under the TCJA, Section 162(m) provided an exception to the deductibility limitations for \u201cperformance-based compensation\u201d that met certain requirements. As amended, beginning in 2018, except for certain grandfathered arrangements in place prior to November 2, 2017 under the amendment\u2019s transition rules, Section 162(m) no longer includes an exception to the limitations for \u201cperformance-based compensation\u201d and expands the group of executive officers covered by the limitation. There are certain unresolved questions regarding how the grandfathering rules are to be implemented. As a result, certain cash and equity-based compensation granted to our executive officers prior to November 2, 2017 that was intended to be exempt from the Section 162(m) deduction limitations may no longer be exempt from the limitations beginning in 2018 and some of the compensation we provide to our executive officers in the future may not be deductible in 2018 and going forward."

Any such changes, as well as those instituted in foreign tax jurisdictions in which we do business today or in the future, that may be enacted could impact our tax liabilities. In addition, the OECD has issued guidelines to its members aimed at encouraging broad-based legislative initiatives intended to prevent base erosion transactions and income shifting in a tax-advantaged manner, known as BEPS. One of the most important areas on which the OECD has focused is the taxation implications of e-commerce businesses (which would potentially include our business). As previously detailed, the OECD issued Action 1 which called for further review and study with the stated expectation that legislative recommendations that seek to equitably allocate the right to tax such e-commerce businesses among all of the jurisdictions that might have an interest in assessing such taxes will be forthcoming. However, it is possible any efforts to assess such taxes by these jurisdictions will be uncoordinated which could result in greater or even double taxation that businesses may not have sufficient means to remedy. Efforts to alleviate this increased tax burden may increase the cost of structuring and compliance. Due to the expanding scale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. or international taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations."

In the event that these third-party providers experience any interruption in operations or cease business for any reason, or if we are unable to agree on satisfactory terms for continued hosting relationships, our business could be harmed and we could be forced to enter into a relationship with other service providers or assume hosting responsibilities ourselves. Although we operate three data centers in an active/standby configuration for geographic redundancy and maintain a fourth disaster recovery facility to back up our collection, a system disruption at an active data center could result in a noticeable disruption to our websites until all website traffic is redirected to the standby data center, which could cause performance degradation at the standby data center."

In February 2017, our Board approved an additional share repurchase program, under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $100 million of our outstanding common stock. The timing and amount of any share repurchases will be determined based on market conditions, share price and other factors. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock at the time of such repurchases. Our board has the right to amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time or terminate the share repurchase program upon a determination that termination would be in our best interests. Additionally, repurchases under our share repurchase program have and will continue to diminish our cash reserves, which could impact our ability to pursue possible strategic opportunities and acquisitions and could result in lower overall returns on our cash balances. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock has declined, and may continue to decline. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness."

For example, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which will come into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. However, legislators have stated that they intend to propose amendments to the CCPA, and it remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to the CCPA or how it will be interpreted. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The scope and interpretation of data privacy and cybersecurity regulations continues to evolve, and we believe that the adoption of increasingly restrictive regulations in this area is likely in the near future within the U.S. at both state and federal levels.

COVID-19 has had a widespread and detrimental effect on the global economy as a result of the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries and actions by public health and governmental authorities, businesses, other organizations and individuals to address the outbreak, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place, stay at home or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. Despite recent developments of vaccines, the duration and severity of COVID-19 and possible mutations and the degree of its impact on our business is uncertain and difficult to predict. The continued spread of the outbreak could result in one or more of the following conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial condition: decreased business spending by our customers and prospective customers, reduced demand for our products, lower renewal rates by our customers; increased customer losses/churn and turnover of talent; increased challenges in or cost of acquiring new customers and talent; reduction in the amount of content uploaded by our contributors and/or reduction in the number of contributors on our site because of reduced royalties earned by our contributors; inability of our Custom contributors and editorial photographers to complete assignments because of travel and in-person event restrictions; increased competition; increased risk in collectability of accounts receivable; reduced productivity due to remote work arrangements; lost productivity due to illness and/or illness of family members; inability to hire key roles; adverse effects on our strategic partners\u2019 businesses; impairment charges; extreme currency exchange-rate fluctuations; inability to recover costs from insurance carriers; business continuity concerns for us and our third-party vendors; inability of counterparties to perform under their agreements with us; increased risk of vulnerability to cybersecurity attacks or breaches resulting from a greater number of our employees working remotely for extended periods of time; and challenges with Internet infrastructure due to high loads.

On October 8, 2021, the OECD announced that over 130 countries had reached a two-pillar agreement to address tax challenges presented by the digitalization of the global economy. Pillar One would require the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises to allocate a portion of their profits to markets where they derive revenue, regardless of whether they maintain a physical presence in those markets. Initially, the profit allocation rule would apply only to multinational enterprises with more than \u20ac20 billion in global annual revenues and a profit margin above 10%. The revenue threshold would be reduced to \u20ac10 billion beginning seven years after the effective date of Pillar One. Pillar Two would subject multinational enterprises with annual revenue of more than \u20ac750 million to a global minimum tax at a rate of 15%. Based on current US tax law, there exists disparity between the US minimum tax under GILTI and the proposed Pillar Two framework. On December 20th the OECD published detailed model legislation for the Pillar Two project, to assist in the implementation of a landmark reform to the international tax system. The participating countries are expected to implement the agreement by entering into a multilateral convention and enacting domestic legislation by 2023. Such legislation could increase our global effective tax rate and have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations."

Fiscal authorities in one or more of those jurisdictions may contend that our tax liabilities or our obligations to remit transactional taxes are greater than in prior taxable periods and more than anticipated relative to future taxable periods. Significant judgment is required in determining our exposure for non-income taxes. These determinations are highly complex and require detailed analysis of the available information and applicable statutes and regulatory materials. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect withholding, sales, use, value added or other taxes on our sales or assess use tax on our purchases may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect or remit such taxes in the future."

The OECD has issued guidelines, referred to as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, or BEPS, to its member-nations aimed at encouraging broad-based legislative initiatives intended to prevent perceived base erosion transactions and income shifting in a tax-advantaged manner. Further, for the past several years, the OECD has had a specific focus on the taxation implications of e-commerce business, generally referred by the OECD as the \u201cdigital economy.\u201d In the fourth quarter of 2019, the OECD released details on its proposed approach which would, among other changes, create a new right to tax certain \u201cdigital economy\u201d income not necessarily based on traditional nexus concepts nor on the \u201carm\u2019s length principle.\u201d Further, in the fall of 2020, the OECD released details on their BEPS Pillars I & II proposals for comment with implementation delayed until mid-year 2021 at the earliest. At this point, there is a lack of consensus agreement among the key members, specifically by the U.S., with the latest OECD proposal. The U.S. has expressed that it would generally support a solution along the lines proposed by the OECD only if the solution was in the form of a \u201csafe-harbor\u201d rather than a mandatory requirement. A failure to reach full consensus on an executable plan within the tight timeframe under which the OECD is operating could result in individual jurisdictions legislating digital tax provisions in an uncoordinated and unilateral manner, and further result in greater or even double taxation that companies may not have sufficient means to remedy. For example, a number of jurisdictions, including the UK, France and Italy, have already adopted or have formally proposed legislation to effect the taxation of certain e-commerce business based on differing criteria and metrics. Efforts to alleviate this increased tax burden will increase the cost of structuring and compliance as well as the cost of doing business internationally. Any changes to the taxation of our international activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations."

          "text": "Pillar Two would subject multinational enterprises with annual revenue of more than \u20ac750 million to a global minimum income tax at a rate of 15%. Based on current U.S. income tax law, disparities exist between the U.S. minimum income tax under the global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) rules and the proposed Pillar Two framework. To assist in the implementation of Pillar Two, the OECD published the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules, a detailed model legislation in December 2021, and related commentary in March 2022. The OECD has released additional administrative guidance on the global minimum income tax in February, July and December of 2023. Under the European Union\u2019s minimum tax directive, unanimously agreed by the member states in 2022, each member state is required to adopt domestic legislation implementing the minimum tax rules effective for periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023, with the \u201cunder-taxed profit rule\u201d to take effect for periods beginning on or after December 31, 2024. Legislatures in multiple countries outside of the European Union have also drafted and/or enacted legislation to implement the OECD\u2019s minimum income tax proposal. Given the OECD\u2019s continued release of guidance regarding Pillar Two, that only certain jurisdictions have currently enacted laws to give effect to Pillar Two, and that jurisdictions may interpret such laws in different manners, the overall implementation of Pillar Two (and in particular, the adoption of the \u201cunder-taxed profit rule\u201d by certain countries in which we and our affiliates do business) remain uncertain and subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, and could increase our global effective tax rate and have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations."

          "text": "Fiscal authorities in many foreign jurisdictions have increased their scrutiny of the potential taxation of e-commerce businesses. The OECD, with the support of the G20, initiated the BEPS project in July 2013 in response to concerns that changes are needed to international tax laws to address situations where multinationals may pay little or no tax in certain jurisdictions by shifting profits away from jurisdictions where the activities creating those profits may take place. In November 2015, \u201cfinal reports\u201d were approved for adoption by the G20 finance ministers. The final reports provide the basis for international standards for corporate taxation that are designed to prevent, among other things, the artificial shifting of income to tax havens and low-tax jurisdictions, hybrid mismatch arrangements, the erosion of the tax base through interest deductions on intercompany debt and the artificial avoidance of permanent establishments (i.e., tax nexus with a jurisdiction). Legislation to adopt and implement these standards has been enacted or is currently under consideration in a number of jurisdictions."

In July 2023, the European Commission issued an adequacy decision on the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework which replaced the Privacy Shield. An entity seeking to transfer personal information under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework must first self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles. The protections afford transfers of personal information under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework was also extended to transfers between the U.S. and U.K. in October 2023."

COVID-19 has had a widespread and detrimental effect on the global economy as a result of the continued fluctuation in the number of cases and affected countries and actions by public health and governmental authorities, businesses, other organizations and individuals to address the outbreak, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place, stay at home or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. Despite the developments of vaccines, the duration and severity of COVID-19 and possible mutations and the degree of its impact on our business is uncertain and difficult to predict. The continued spread of the outbreak could result in one or more of the following conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial condition: decreased business spending by our customers and prospective customers; reduced demand for our products, lower renewal rates by our customers; increased customer losses/churn and turnover of talent; increased challenges in or cost of acquiring new customers and talent; reduction in the amount of content uploaded by our contributors and/or reduction in the number of contributors on our site because of reduced royalties earned by our contributors; inability of our Custom contributors and editorial photographers to complete assignments because of travel and in-person event restrictions; increased competition; increased risk in collectability of accounts receivable; reduced productivity due to remote work arrangements; lost productivity due to illness and/or illness of family members; inability to hire key roles; adverse effects on our strategic partners\u2019 businesses; impairment charges; extreme currency exchange-rate fluctuations; inability to recover costs from insurance carriers; business continuity concerns for us and our third-party vendors; inability of counterparties to perform under their agreements with us; increased risk of vulnerability to cybersecurity attacks or breaches resulting from a greater number of our employees working remotely for extended periods of time; and challenges with Internet infrastructure due to high loads. If we are not able to respond to and manage the potential impact of such events effectively, our business could be harmed."

Our efforts to help mitigate the negative impact of the outbreak on our business may not be effective, and we may be affected by a protracted economic downturn. Furthermore, while many governmental authorities around the world have and continue to enact legislation to address the impact of COVID-19, including measures intended to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated economic effects of the virus, we may not benefit from such legislation or such legislation may prove to be ineffective in addressing COVID-19\u2019s impact on our and our customer\u2019s businesses and operations. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience impacts to our business as a result of the coronavirus\u2019 global economic impact and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. Further, as the COVID-19 situation is unprecedented and continuously evolving, COVID-19 may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or in a manner that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations."
