The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing\ninternational tax principles. As countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company's\nincome taxes. Local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. In addition,\nIBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities around the world. The company regularly assesses the\nlikelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will\nnot have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability."

As a\nresult, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide\nincremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. Further, the company's results of operations and financial results\ncould be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases can be significant due to the level of insolvencies of\nunrelated companies in the country at issue. Currently, Canada, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of plan assets, which\ncould negatively impact the company's earnings. IBM's 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding\npension matters."

Computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services, and systems. The risk of such attacks to the\ncompany includes attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. Successful\nbreaches could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft of sensitive,\nregulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property; and system disruptions or denial of service. In the event of such breaches, the company, its customers or\nother third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other\nfinancial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. The company experiences and responds to\ncybersecurity threats, although none has had a material adverse effect on the company to date. As the cybersecurity landscape evolves, the company may also find it necessary to make significant\nfurther investments to protect data and infrastructure. As a global enterprise, the company and its business practices related to data, including personal data, could also be impacted by existing and\nproposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization and data protection, and the potential impact to the company of any\nsuch laws or regulations, as well as potential security breaches, could become greater.

The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the\ncompany's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. As a result of the above-mentioned\nfactors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition,\nthe high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect IBM's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the\nquarter."
