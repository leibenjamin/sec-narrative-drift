The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. As countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company'sincome taxes. Local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities around the world. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability."

As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. Further, the company's results of operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases can be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. Currently, Canada, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of plan assets, which could negatively impact the company's earnings. IBM's 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters."

The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and an increased number of data protection laws around the globe could continue to result in increased compliance costs and risks as a result of (i) increased regulatory enforcement of GDPR and other data protection rules and (ii) the trend of shifting and sharing data processing responsibilities from companies having direct relationship with consumers to all companies in the data processing chain. Any additional costs and penalties associated with increased compliance and risk reduction could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market."

Completion of the announced spin-off, as well as the timing of completion, is subject to the readiness of NewCo to operate as an independent public company, finalization of the financial statements of NewCo, assurance that the separation will be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, finalization of the capital structure of the company and NewCo, the effectiveness of appropriate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, final approval of the IBM Board of Directors, and other customary items. The announced spin-off is complex in nature and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions. There is the potential for business disruption and, as previously disclosed, the company expects significant separation costs. These or other unanticipated developments or costs could delay or prevent the announced spin-off or cause the announced spin-off to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable than anticipated. Furthermore, if the spin-off is completed, there is no guarantee that it will be successful in meeting its objectives or achieving its intended benefits. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations."

For example, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. In the current macroeconomic environment, clients continue to balance short-term challenges and opportunities for transformation. Their short-term priorities continue to be focused on operational stability, flexibility and cash preservation, and as such, we may experience some disruptions in transactional performance. Additionally, clients\u2019 short-term priorities, as well as quarantines, limitations on travel and other factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may result in delays in some services projects. Another example, the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U., commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d has caused global economic, trade and regulatory uncertainty. The company is actively monitoring and planning for possible impacts from Brexit."

In addition, certain of the company\u2019s growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company\u2019s financial results. The company\u2019s financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers\u2019 businesses; for example, certain of the company\u2019s services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. Further, general economic conditions, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity such as those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the company\u2019s financial results in any particular period. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company\u2019s financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to predict."

          "text": "Cybersecurity and Privacy Considerations Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: There are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including risks originating from intentional acts of criminal hackers, hacktivists, nation states and competitors; from intentional and unintentional acts or omissions of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties; and from errors in processes or technologies, as well as the risks associated with an increase in the number of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties working remotely. Computer hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products, services, systems and networks using a wide variety of methods, including ransomware or other malicious software and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and infrastructure. Attacks also include social engineering and cyber extortion to induce customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties to disclose information, transfer funds, or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. The company is at risk of security breaches not only of our own products, services, systems and networks, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties, particularly as all parties increasingly digitize their operations. Cyber threats are continually evolving, including with the increased use of AI, making it difficult to defend against such threats and vulnerabilities that can persist undetected over extended periods of time."

As the reliance on data grows for the company and our clients, the potential impact of regulations on the company\u2019s business, risks, and reputation will grow accordingly. The enactment and expansion of cybersecurity, data protection and privacy laws, regulations and standards around the globe will continue to result in increased compliance costs, including due to an increased focus on international data transfer mechanisms and data location; increased cybersecurity requirements and reporting obligations; the lack of harmonization of such laws and regulations; the increase in associated litigation and enforcement activity by governments and private parties; the potential for damages, fines and penalties and debarment; and the potential regulation of new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Any additional costs and penalties associated with increased compliance, enforcement, and risk reduction could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market or maintaining certain offerings."
