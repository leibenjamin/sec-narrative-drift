During fiscal 2016, we were notified that a third party service provider that hosts the online photo center for Walmart Canada suffered a security breach that compromised information of users of that company's site, including some Walmart Canada customers, which we believe has not had a material impact on Walmart Canada or the Company. Walmart Canada discontinued use of this third party service provider. Sam's Club in the United States also used the same third party service provider to host its online photo center through a different system than the one used by Walmart Canada. After the breach in Canada, Sam's Club suspended the operation of the online photo center until a security review could be completed by the third party service provider. Once the security review was complete and new technology with enhanced security measures was implemented by the third party service provider, along with a determination that the information of Sam's Club members was not compromised by the security breach, Sam's Club resumed the operation of the online photo center through the same third party service provider."

If we are unable to open new supercenters, discount stores, Neighborhood Markets, other small formats or Sam's Clubs or continue to convert discount stores into supercenters, our financial performance, such as net sales and operating income growth, could be materially adversely affected.

Economic, business and legal environments in foreign markets may be such that we are unable to expand our operations and increase our net sales in those markets as we may want to do and could result in the closure of our existing units in such markets, which closures impede the growth of our international operations. Finally, some countries have foreign investment laws that prohibit us or limit us from holding a controlling interest in retail operations in those countries, making our entry into those markets, which may present attractive growth opportunities, more difficult, if not impossible. If we cannot effectively continue to expand our Walmart International segment, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected."

Fiscal 2018 included cash received of $1.0 billion from the sale of Suburbia in Mexico, while fiscal 2017 included our acquisition of Jet.com, Inc. (\"jet.com\") for $2.4 billion and our purchase of $1.9 billion of shares in JD.com (\"JD\"). Refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our acquisition of jet.com and investment in JD.

Despite increased net sales from the strong demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic, which included additional costs such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices and security, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves. Additionally, the increase in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales. For fiscal 2020, the decrease was primarily the result of lower labor-related costs and a charge of approximately $50 million related to lease exit costs in the prior comparable period. These benefits were partially offset by a reduction in sales of tobacco and a higher level of technology investment."

Fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was also slightly aided by lapping the $0.5 billion business restructuring charges from the prior year described below, offset by a $0.4 billion business restructuring charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 resulting from changes to Walmart U.S. support teams to better support its omni-channel strategy. The decrease in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to strong sales and productivity improvements which were mostly offset by business restructuring charges of $0.5 billion consisting primarily of non-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology and other business restructuring charges due to decisions that resulted in the write down of certain eCommerce assets."

Overall net sales growth was strong despite certain operating limitations in several international markets in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to government regulations and precautionary measures taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The net sales increase was partially offset by negative fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $5.0 billion. For fiscal 2020, net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, along with the addition of net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in August 2018, and positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets. These increases were partially offset by $4.1 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates in fiscal 2020 and our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018."

The DEA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. In addition, there has been recent heightened governmental and public scrutiny of pharmaceutical product pricing, which has resulted in federal and state legislation and regulations, executive orders and other initiatives and proposals designed to increase transparency in pharmaceutical product pricing and reform government program reimbursement methodologies (for example, the Inflation Reduction Act, which includes, among other matters, policies designed to impact drug prices and reduce drug spending by the federal government). Other health reform efforts at the federal and state levels may also impact our business or require us to modify certain aspects of our operations.

On December 22, 2020, the DOJ filed a civil complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies in violation of the CSA. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. Since that time, the District Court stayed further proceedings in the DOJ complaint pending the decision of the United States Supreme Court in two other cases interpreting the CSA, which have been consolidated into Ruan v.

As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions. Whether laws related to these marketplace transactions, including, but not limited to, intellectual property and products liability laws, apply to us is currently unsettled and any unfavorable changes or interpretations could expose us to liability, loss of sales, reduction in transactions and deterioration of our competitive position. In addition, we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for third-party sales of goods that are controversial, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen, or otherwise fail to comply with applicable law or the proprietary rights of others. Although we have marketplace compliance controls and impose contractual terms on sellers to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect certain prohibited items, enforce such terms, or collect sufficient damages for breaches. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our eCommerce growth and enterprise strategy."

On September 13, 2024, those subsidiaries received a non-confidential version of the DG's Investigation Report (the \"Report\"), alleging certain competition law violations. CCI is not bound by the Report, and will conduct its independent analysis of the allegations, including hearing objections from the subsidiaries and other parties before issuing its final order in the matter, which could include monetary and non-monetary relief. CCI's final order would also be subject to appropriate appellate proceedings.

The qualification processes and background checks we utilize when engaging independent contractors may not reveal all potentially relevant information, including accurate worker authorization information and criminal history. If these independent contractors engage in misconduct, consumers may not consider our goods and services safe, and we may receive negative press coverage.

On December 23, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") filed a lawsuit against the Company and Branch Messenger, Inc. in the District of Minnesota alleging the Company violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act by allegedly requiring independent contractor drivers on the Spark platform to receive payments through a financial product offered by Branch.
