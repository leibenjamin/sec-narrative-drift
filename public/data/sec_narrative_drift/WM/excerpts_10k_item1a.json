However, the new United States presidential administration has called for substantial changes to areas of federal tax and foreign trade policy and has generally appeared to be in favor of reducing regulation, including environmental regulation. We cannot predict what impact the new administration will have on the political and regulatory environment in the United States, the timing of any such changes, or the impact of any such changes on our business. While reduction of regulation may have a favorable impact on our operating costs, the extensive environmental regulation applicable to landfills is a substantial barrier to entry that benefits our Company.

There remains heightened attention from the public, some states and the EPA to the alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water supplies. There is also heightened federal regulatory focus on emissions of methane that occur during drilling and transportation of natural gas with regulations promulgated in 2012 and 2015 as well as state attention to protective disposal of drilling residuals. Increased regulation of oil and gas exploration and production and new rules regarding the treatment and disposal of wastes associated with exploration and production operations could increase our costs to provide oilfield services and reduce our margins and revenue from such services."

EPR regulations are designed to place either partial or total responsibility on producers to fund the post-use life cycle of the products they create. Along with the funding responsibility, producers may be required to take over management of local recycling programs by taking back their products from end users or managing the collection operations and recycling processing infrastructure. There is no federal lawestablishing EPR in the United States or Canada; however, state, provincial and local governments could, and in some cases have, taken steps to implement EPR regulations. If wide-ranging EPR regulations were adopted, they could have a fundamental impact on the waste streams we manage and how we operate our business, including contract terms and pricing.

A weak economy generally results in decreased consumer spending and decreases in volumes of waste generated, which decreases our revenues. A weak market for consumer goods can significantly decrease demand by paper mills for recycled corrugated cardboard used in packaging; such decrease in demand can negatively impact commodity prices and our operating income and cash flows. In addition, we have a relatively high fixed-cost structure, which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume levels. Consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence may limit the number or amount of services requested by customers. Economic conditions may also limit our ability to implement our pricing strategy. For example, many of our contracts have price adjustment provisions that are tied to an index such as the Consumer Price Index, and our costs may increase in excess of the increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index. Additionally, a prolonged economic downturn in China could significantly impact prices for post-consumer fiber and metals processed by our recycling operations."

The constrained labor market has resulted in increased costs for wage adjustments, overtime hours and training new hires to address operational challenges servicing customers. The COVID-19 pandemic and the constrained labor market have also contributed to significant global supply chain disruption and inflationary pressure for the goods and services we purchase, with a particular impact on our repair and maintenance costs. Supply chain constraints have also caused delayed delivery of fleet, steel containers and other purchases. Aspects of our business rely on third-party transportation providers, and such services have become more limited and expensive. Additionally, we are currently experiencing margin pressures from commodity-driven business impacts, particularly from recycling brokerage rebates and higher fuel prices. The extent and duration of the impact of these labor market, supply chain and transportation challenges are subject to numerous factors, including the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; size, location and qualifications of the labor pool; behavioral changes; wage and price structures; adoption of new or revised regulations; and broader macroeconomic conditions.

The acquired Stericycle business, which is now presented as our new WM Healthcare Solutions segment, is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause performance to be materially different than we anticipate; such factors include, but are not limited to, decreases in the volume of medical waste and controlled substances wastes or personal and confidential information collected from customers; disruptions resulting from deployment of systems, including with respect to the implementation of Stericycle\u2019s enterprise resource planning system and billing and collection delays that Stericycle has experienced following the launch of such system upgrade; changing market conditions in the healthcare industry; competition and demand for services for the medical waste, controlled substances waste and secure information destruction industries; commodity price volatility; changes in regulation of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal or destruction of medical waste and controlled substances waste or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; the level of government enforcement of regulations governing medical waste and controlled substances waste collection and treatment or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information; and the outcome of pending, future or settled litigation or investigations. Should the Stericycle business be unsuccessful in achieving financial and operational targets and implementing the WM Healthcare Solutions business strategy, it could negatively impact our realization of benefits from the acquisition, as well as our stock price and our future business and financial results."

Additionally, Stericycle\u2019s secure information destruction services are subject to additional laws and regulations regarding proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information. Relaxation of enforcement, government shutdowns, or other changes in governmental regulation of medical waste and controlled substances waste and personal and confidential information could increase the number of competitors we face or reduce or delay the need for these services."

          "text": "Providing environmental and waste management services, including constructing and operating landfills, transfer stations, processing facilities, recycling facilities and other disposal or destruction facilities, and landfill gas-to-energy facilities, involves risks such as truck accidents, equipment defects, malfunctions and failures, and improper use of dangerous equipment. Additionally, we closely monitor and manage landfills to minimize the risk of waste mass instability, releases of hazardous materials, and odors that are sometimes triggered by weather or natural disasters. There are also risks presented by the potential for subsurface heat reactions causing elevated landfill temperatures and increased production of leachate, landfill gas and odors, and we have proactively incurred increased costs to manage leachate in response to this risk. We build and operate natural gas fueling stations, some of which also serve the public or third parties. Operation of fueling stations and landfill gas collection and control systems, as well as operation of heavy machinery and management of flammable materials at our recycling facilities and transfer stations, involves additional risks of fire and explosion. The Stericycle business requires handling of medical waste and controlled substances waste. Incidents such as truck accidents, damaged or leaking containers, improper storage of medical waste and controlled substances waste, placement of prohibited materials into the waste stream, or malfunctioning plant equipment could result in exposure to contaminated or infectious waste or other hazardous materials."

          "text": "Predominantly all of the Company\u2019s revenues are generated in the U.S., and changes in U.S. tax laws could materially impact our effective tax rate, financial condition and results of operations. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), had a significant impact on our effective tax rate, cash tax expenses and net deferred tax liabilities. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate and eliminated or limited the deduction of several expenses that were previously deductible, among other things. However, future changes in tax laws could reverse the impacts of the Tax Act and if ultimately enacted into law, such an increase could materially impact our tax provision, cash tax liability, effective tax rate and net deferred tax liabilities."

The downturn in market prices for recycling commodities that started in the second half of 2022 continued in 2023. Average market prices for single-stream recycled commodities were down 40% in 2023 when compared to the comparable prior year period. Decreases in the market prices for recycling commodities resulted in a decrease in recycling revenues attributable to yield of $308 million in 2023 as compared to the prior year period. Recycling revenues attributable to yield increased $19 million in 2022 as compared with the prior year period, primarily from higher market prices for recycling commodities in the first half of 2022, before the significant downturn in the second half of 2022."

Significant expenditures and commitment of time by management, employees and consultants is involved in developing, implementing and overseeing policies, practices, additional disclosures and internal controls related to environmental and sustainability risk and performance. Public statements with respect to ESG matters are becoming increasingly subject to heightened scrutiny from public and governmental authorities related to the risk of potential \u201cgreenwashing,\u201d i.e., misleading information or false claims overstating potential ESG benefits. We are aware that non-governmental organizations and other private actors have filed lawsuits against certain companies under various securities and consumer protection laws alleging that certain ESG-related statements, goals or standards were misleading, false or otherwise deceptive. An inability to implement such policies, practices, and internal controls and maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or a perception among stakeholders that our ESG disclosures and sustainability goals are insufficient or our goals are unattainable, could harm our reputation and competitive position and negatively impact our stock price and business performance."
