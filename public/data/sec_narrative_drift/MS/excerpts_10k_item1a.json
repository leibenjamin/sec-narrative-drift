In particular, as a result of these reforms, we are, or will become, subject to (among other things) significantly revised and expanded regulation and supervision, more intensive scrutiny of our businesses and any plans for expansion of those businesses, new activities limitations, a systemic risk regime that imposes heightened capital and liquidity requirements and other enhanced prudential standards, new resolution regimes and resolution planning requirements, new requirements for maintaining minimum amounts of external total loss-absorbing capacity and external long-term debt, new restrictions on activities and investments imposed by the Volcker Rule, and comprehensive new derivatives regulation. While certain portions of these reforms are effective, others are still subject to final rulemaking or transition periods. Many of the changes required by these reforms could materially impact the profitability of our businesses and the value of assets we hold, expose us to additional costs, require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses, adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our stock, or require us to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely impact our shareholders or creditors. In addition, regulatory requirements that are being proposed by foreign policymakers and regulators may be inconsistent or conflict with regulations that we are subject to in the U.S. and, if adopted, may adversely affect us. While there continues to be uncertainty about the full impact of these changes, we do know that the Company is and will continue to be subject to a more complex regulatory framework, and will incur costs to comply with new requirements as well as to monitor for compliance in the future."

Under these extreme conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under more normal market conditions. Moreover, under these conditions market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale. Our risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk to more extreme market moves. However, severe market events have historically been difficult to predict and we could realize significant losses if extreme market events were to occur."

Morgan Stanley sponsors free and confidential mental health counseling for all employees and their dependents (which vary by location). In 2020, the Firm introduced a new mental health benefit in the U.S. that provides access to therapists, mental health coaches and other resources. Further, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees. These changes include having the vast majority of our employees work from home and providing productivity resources when necessary, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work, committing to no reductions in force through 2020, COVID-19-specific medical benefits, extended childcare benefits and modified work schedules."

Submission of interim targeted information by our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries generally will not be required during a year which the Parent Company is required to submit a resolution plan to the Federal Reserve and FDIC. The first submission for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under this rule will be in 2026. In addition, the OCC requires IDIs with assets of $100 billion or more, including our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, to develop recovery plans detailing the actions they would take to remain a going concern when they experience considerable financial or non-financial stress, but have not deteriorated to the point that resolution is imminent. Our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to develop a recovery plan by January 2026."
