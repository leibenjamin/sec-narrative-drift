Any dispositions we undertake may involve numerous risks and uncertainties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. In particular, we may not be able to successfully complete any disposition on a timeline or on terms acceptable to us, if at all, whether due to market conditions, regulatory challenges or other concerns. In addition, the reinvestment of capital from disposition proceeds may not ultimately yield investment returns in line with our internal or external expectations. Any dispositions we pursue may also result in disruption to other parts of our business, including through the diversion of resources and management attention from our ongoing business and other strategic matters, or through the disruption of relationships with our employees and key vendors. Further, in connection with any disposition, we may enter into transition services agreements or undertake indemnity or other obligations that may result in additional expenses for us."

We compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the exploration and production business, including to locate and obtain new sources of supply and to produce oil, bitumen, natural gas and natural gas liquids in an efficient, cost-effective manner. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do or may be willing to incur a higher level of risk than we are willing to incur to obtain potential sources of supply. If we are not successful in our competition for new reserves, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected."

Due to the significant recent decline in prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, natural gas liquids and LNG, and the expectation that these prices could remain depressed in the near future, the major ratings agencies have indicated they will be conducting a review of the oil and gas industry and the debt ratings for some companies operating in the industry may be downgraded.

Approximately 54 percent of our hydrocarbon production from continuing operations was derived from production outside the United States in 2015, and 61 percent of our proved reserves, as of December 31, 2015, was located outside the United States. We are subject to risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, bitumen, natural gasliquids or LNG pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments, changing political conditions and international monetary fluctuations. In particular, some countries where we operate lack well-developed legal systems or have not adopted clear legal and regulatory frameworks for oil and gas exploration and production. This lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risks, including increased difficulty in enforcing our agreements in those jurisdictions and increased risks of adverse actions by local government authorities, such as expropriations."

          "text": "One area subject to significant political and regulatory activity is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal and national laws and regulations currently govern or, in some hydraulic fracturing operations, prohibit hydraulic fracturing in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and others which could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Certain jurisdictions in which we operate, including state and local governments in Colorado, have adopted or are considering regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or other regulatory requirements on hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural-gasoperations, including subsurface water disposal. In addition, certain interest groups have also proposed ballot initiatives and constitutional amendments designed to restrict oil and natural-gasdevelopment generally and hydraulic fracturing in particular. For example, in 2018, Colorado voters rejected Proposition 112, a Colorado ballot initiative that would have drastically limited the use of hydraulic fracturing in Colorado. In the event that ballot initiatives, local or state restrictions or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas in areas where we conduct operations, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration, development or production activities. Such compliance costs and delays, curtailments, limitations or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity."

Our operations are subject to additional hazards concerning exposure to and potential release of pollutants and toxic substances, as well as other environmental hazards and risks. For example, offshore activities may pose incrementally greater risks because of complex subsurface conditions such as higher reservoir pressures, water depths and metocean conditions. All such hazards could result in loss of human life, significant property and equipment damage, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, substantial losses to us and damage to our reputation. Our business and operations may be disrupted if we do not respond, or are perceived not to respond, in an appropriate manner to any of these hazards and risks or any other major crisis or if we are unable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational components and capacity. Countermeasures to address global health crises, epidemics or pandemics, including future outbreaks of COVID-19, may result in reduced demand for our products; disruptions to our supply chain, the global economy or financial or commodity markets; disruptions in our contractual arrangements with our service providers, suppliers and other counterparties; failures by our suppliers, contract manufacturers, contractors, joint venture partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us; reduced workforce productivity; and voluntary or involuntary curtailments. Further, our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses described above, and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us in the future or may not be available."

In 2022, we published our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition (the \u201cPlan\u201d) and continued to set increasingly ambitious targets around operational GHG emissions intensity and reducing methane emissions and flaring. Our ability to achieve stated targets, goals and ambitions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties out of our control, government policies and markets, as well as potential regulations that may impair our ability to execute on current or future plans. Such achievement also depends on the accelerated pace of development of effective emissions measurement and abatement technologies, and the actual pace of development may be inadequate, or the technologies actually developed may be insufficient. Furthermore, we are still in the planning stages, and the Plan's execution could be costly, may have unforeseen obstacles, may proceed at varying paces during the timeframe allotted for the Plan and may be accomplished in a manner that we cannot predict at this time. We may be required to purchase emission credits in the future, and there may be an insufficient supply of offsets to achieve our goals, or we could incur increasingly greater expenses related to our purchase of such offsets. As advanced technologies are developed to accurately measure emissions, we may be required to revise our emissions estimates and reduction goals or otherwise revise our strategies outlined in the Plan. We may be adversely affected and potentially need to reduce economic end-of-field life of certain assets and impair associated net book value due to the emissions intensity of some of our assets. Even if we meet our goals, our efforts may be characterized as insufficient."

For example, a significant number of financial institutions are now members of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), thereby pledging to the goal of net zero by 2050, as well as setting interim targets for 2030 or earlier. While they are not prohibited from doing business with oil and gas companies, GFANZ members may self-impose limits. Conversely, we also face pressure from some in the investment community and certain public interest groups to limit the focus on ESG in our decision-making, arguing that ESG considerations do not relate to financial outcomes. As public pressure continues to mount on the financial sector, our costs of capital may increase."

We must also compete for the materials, equipment, services, employees and other personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists) necessary to conduct our business. If we are not successful in any facet of this competition, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected."
