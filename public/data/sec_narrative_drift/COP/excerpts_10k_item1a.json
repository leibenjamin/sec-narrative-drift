In addition, the reinvestment of capital from disposition proceeds may not ultimately yield investment returns in line with our internal or\nexternal expectations. Any dispositions we pursue may also result in disruption to other parts of our business, including through the diversion of resources and management attention from our ongoing business and other strategic matters, or through\nthe disruption of relationships with our employees and key vendors.

Approximately 54 percent of our hydrocarbon production from continuing operations was derived from production outside the United States in 2015, and 61 percent of our proved reserves, as of\nDecember 31, 2015, was located outside the United States. We are subject to risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, bitumen, natural gas\nliquids or LNG pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments, changing political conditions and international monetary fluctuations. In particular, some countries where we operate lack well-developed legal systems or\nhave not adopted clear legal and regulatory frameworks for oil and gas exploration and production. This lack of legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risks, including increased difficulty in enforcing our agreements in those\njurisdictions and increased risks of adverse actions by local government authorities, such as expropriations."

          "text": "One area subject to significant political and regulatory activity is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates\nproduction of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal and national laws and regulations currently govern or, in some hydraulic fracturing operations, prohibit hydraulic fracturing\nin some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, a number of new laws, regulations and permitting requirements are under consideration by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and others which could\nresult in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Certain jurisdictions in which we operate, including state and local governments in Colorado, have adopted or are\nconsidering regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or other regulatory requirements on hydraulic fracturing or other oil and\nnatural-gas\noperations, including subsurface\nwater disposal. In addition, certain interest groups have also proposed ballot initiatives and constitutional amendments designed to restrict oil and\nnatural-gas\ndevelopment generally and hydraulic fracturing\nin particular. For example, in 2018, Colorado voters rejected Proposition 112, a Colorado ballot initiative that would have drastically limited the use of hydraulic fracturing in Colorado. In the event that ballot initiatives, local or state\nrestrictions or prohibitions are adopted and result in more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas in areas where we conduct operations, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may\nexperience delays or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration, development or production activities. Such compliance costs and delays, curtailments, limitations or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nprospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity."

          "text": "An example is the use of hydraulic fracturing, an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formations. A range of local, state, federal, or national laws and regulations currently govern hydraulic fracturing operations, with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdictions. Although hydraulic fracturing has been conducted for many decades, potential new laws, regulations and permitting requirements from various state environmental agencies, and others could result in increased costs, operating restrictions, operational delays and/or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resources. Governmental restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investments. We have adopted operating principles that incorporate established industry standards designed to meet or exceed government requirements. Our practices continually evolve as technology improves and regulations change."

          "text": "For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition."

Demonstrating our commitment to maintaining and enhancing balance sheet strength, in 2022, we executed several activities focused on debt reduction, including early retiring and refinancing some of our debt. In aggregate, these transactions along with naturally maturing debt reduced the company's total debt by $3.3 billion. These activities facilitate our ability to achieve our previously announced $5 billion debt reduction target by the end of 2026, while also reducing the company's annual cash interest expense.\nSee Note\n9\n."
