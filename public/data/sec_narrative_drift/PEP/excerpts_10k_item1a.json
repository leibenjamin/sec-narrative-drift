These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per liquid ounce while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar in the beverage. For example, effective January 2017, the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the United States enacted a per-ounce surcharge on all sweetened beverages (including artificially and non-caloric sweetened beverages). By contrast, the U.K. has proposed a graduated tax, in which the per-ounce tax rate is tied to the amount of added sugar present in the beverage: the higher the amount of added sugar, the higher the per-ounce tax rate. These tax measures - whatever their scope or form - could increase the cost of our products, reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity"

For example, taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages were imposed in Mexico and Berkeley, California; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering requiring nutrition labels to include information about added sugars; and Brazil and Vermont have enacted legislation requiring labeling of products that contain genetically modified ingredients. In addition, a number of other jurisdictions in the United States and outside the United States are considering similar measures. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions, other jurisdictions may follow and the requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, may result in adverse publicity (whether or not valid). For example, if one jurisdiction imposes a specific labeling requirement or requires a specific warning on any product that contains certain ingredients or substances, other jurisdictions may react and impose restrictions on products containing the same ingredients or substances, which may result in adverse publicity or increased concerns about the health implications of consumption of such ingredients or substances in our products (whether or not valid). Changes in regulatory requirements, and competing regulations and standards, where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, may result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher production costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations."

The changes in the TCJ Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the TCJ Act may have on our business and financial results. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings regardless of whether they are repatriated, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed limitations on the deductibility of interest and certain other corporate deductions, and moved from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation that generally allows deferral of U.S. tax on international earnings until repatriated to a \u201cterritorial\u201d/dividend exemption system with a minimum tax that will subject international earnings to U.S. tax when earned.

Further, certain jurisdictions are considering imposing other types of regulations or policies, including packaging taxes, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to the plastic bottle, minimum recycled content mandates, which would require packaging to include a certain percentage of post-consumer recycled material in a new package, and even bans on the use of some plastic beverage bottles and other single-use plastics.

Increases in income tax rates or other changes in income tax laws in any particular jurisdiction can reduce our after-tax income from such jurisdiction and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

In addition, existing tax laws in the United States and many of the other countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including countries in which we have significant operations, have been and could in the future be subject to significant change. For example, in December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) was signed into law in the United States. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act is deemed to be complete, these amounts are based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may continue to impact our recorded amounts in future periods. In addition, o n May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF), effective January 1, 2020. Certain provisions of the TRAF were enacted in fiscal year 2019, resulting in adjustments to our deferred taxes. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be estimated and we continue to monitor and assess the impact of TRAF on our business and financial results.

The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risk, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets and other corporate banking services, including working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging and raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets or result in additional impairment charges. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our employees, operations, customers, consumers or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals.

Certain of our products are sold in packaging designed to be recyclable, commercially compostable, biodegradable or reusable. However, not all packaging is recovered, whether due to lack of infrastructure or otherwise, and certain of our packaging is not currently recyclable, commercially compostable, biodegradable or reusable. Packaging waste not properly disposed of that displays one or more of our brands has in the past resulted in and could continue to result in negative publicity, litigation, government action or reduced consumer demand for our products, adversely affecting our financial performance. Many jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed or are considering imposing laws, regulations or policies intended to encourage the use of sustainable packaging, waste reduction or increased recycling rates or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging. These laws, regulations and policies vary in form and scope and include extended producer responsibility policies, plastic or packaging taxes, restrictions on certain products and materials, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to bottles, restrictions or bans on the use of certain types of packaging, including single-use plastics and packaging containing PFAS, restrictions on labeling related to recyclability and requirements to charge deposit fees. For example, the European Union, Peru and certain states in the United States, among other jurisdictions, have imposed a minimum recycled content requirement for beverage bottle packaging and similar legislation is under consideration in other jurisdictions. These laws and regulations have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of our products, impact demand for our products, result in negative publicity and require us and our business partners, including our independent bottlers, to increase capital expenditures to invest in reducing the amount of virgin plastic or other materials used in our packaging, to develop alternative packaging or to revise product labeling, all of which can adversely affect our business and financial performance."
