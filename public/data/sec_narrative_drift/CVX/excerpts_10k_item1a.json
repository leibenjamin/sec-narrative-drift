For example, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries are studying and may adopt additional policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. In some jurisdictions, the company is already subject to currently implemented programs such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard program, the European Union Emissions Trading System, and the California cap-and-trade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligations. Other jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms such as, for example, via a carbon tax (e.g., Singapore and Canada) or via a cap-and-trade program (e.g., Mexico and China). The landscape continues to be in a state of constant re-assessment and legal challenge with respect to these laws and regulations, making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact they will have on the company in the aggregate."

Cyber threat actors could compromise the company\u2019s process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Further, the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on third-party IT systems, including the cloud. The company has limited control and visibility over such third-party IT systems. Cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business and results of operations."

At 50 percent-owned Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan, COVID-19 infections have led to the demobilization of a significant portion of the workforce, adversely impacting the construction pace for completion of the FGP/WPMP project. Although infection levels in Kazakhstan improved in the third quarter 2020, allowing remobilization of the FGP/WPMP construction workforce to commence, a resurgence of infections prevented the final five percent of the planned workforce from returning to work in the fourth quarter 2020, slowing progress on the project. The ultimate effects of COVID-19 on FGP/WPMP construction remain uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. In particular, we are currently unable to predict whether COVID-19 will have a material adverse impact on our ability to complete FGP/WPMP on schedule or within the current cost estimate for the project."
