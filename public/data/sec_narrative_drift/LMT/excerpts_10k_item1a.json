The IS&GS business (through a\nsubsidiary created for the transaction) has entered into a commitment letter (the \u0093Commitment Letter\u0094) with certain financial institutions to provide this financing through $710 million of Term Loan A facilities and a $1.13 billion Term\nLoan B facility.

However, our businesses with smaller, short-term contracts are the most susceptible to the impacts of budget reductions, such as our Information Systems & Global Solutions (IS&GS) business segment. We\nhave also experienced increased market pressures in these services businesses including lower in-theater support as troop levels are drawn down and increased re-competition on existing contracts coupled with the fragmentation of large contracts into\nmultiple smaller contracts that are awarded primarily on the basis of price. Additionally, our services businesses across most of our business segments have experienced lower volume due to improved product field performance that require less service\nsupport.

(Leidos) in a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust transaction. As part of the transaction, we will receive a $1.8 billion\none-time special cash payment. The cash payment is subject to adjustment and could be less or more than anticipated due to variances in working capital. Additionally, our stockholders will receive approximately 50.5 percent of the outstanding equity\nof Leidos on a fully diluted basis (approximately 77 million shares) with an estimated value of $3.2 billion based on Leidos\u0092 stock price on the date of announcement. However, the actual value of the stock to be received by our\nstockholders will depend on the value of such shares at the time of closing of the transaction and our stockholders may receive more or less than the anticipated value. At our election, the distribution may be effected by means of a pro rata\ndividend in a spin-off transaction or in an exchange offer for outstanding Lockheed Martin shares in a split-off transaction. The transaction structure, which is subject to market conditions, is currently contemplated to be a split-off transaction\nresulting in a decrease in our outstanding common shares and a significant book gain at closing. In a split-off transaction, only those stockholders that elect to participate will receive Leidos shares in the merger transaction, provided, that, if\nthe exchange offer is not fully subscribed, Lockheed Martin will spin-off the remaining shares to be converted into Leidos stock in the merger pro rata. The value of the shares of Leidos stock to be received and the value of our stock at the time of\nthe split-off will also impact the number of any shares of our stock retired in the split-off and the amount of any book gain. Although the transaction structure is currently contemplated to be a split-off transaction, there is no assurance that the\ntransaction will be structured as a split-off transaction or that it will result in a reduction in our shares or a gain at closing."

Brexit may also have adverse tax effects on movement of products or sustainment activities between the UK and EU. Additionally, Brexit may impact the value of the pound sterling. If the pound sterling were to remain depressed against the U.S. dollar, this could negatively impact the ability of the UK government to afford our products. Currently, we do not anticipate that Brexit will have a material impact on our operations or our financial results. While we have operations in the UK, these operations have little activity between the UK and the EU (e.g., sales, supply chain, or reliance on personnel).

The underlying budget impasse remains, and it is possible that there will be a further partial shutdown or shutdowns. As noted above, while the corporation\u2019s largest customer, the DoD, is funded through the end of the government FY 2019 and thus would not be affected by another shutdown, limiting the direct impact of any future shutdown or shutdowns on Lockheed Martin, other customers, such as NASA, are not. In the event of future shutdowns, we may continue to work on unfunded contracts to seek to maintain their projected cost and schedule profiles which, although we would anticipate being paid when the shutdown ends, would put us at risk of nonpayment. Further there may be indirect impacts such as the potential diversion of funds from the DoD and the fact that the Departments of State and Commerce cease to timely process export licenses. While in the recent shutdown there were procedures in place to process on an emergency basis licenses involving direct support to the military, humanitarian aid, or other similar emergencies, there was a growing backlog of non-emergency applications. We anticipate that this will occur again in any future shutdown. While the impact on Lockheed Martin of the recent shutdown was not material, were a future shutdown to occur and continue for an extended period, this might not be the case. In addition, the President has not yet submitted a budget proposal for FY 2020 to Congress. If an annual appropriations bill is not enacted for FY 2020 or beyond, the U.S. Government may operate under a continuing resolution, restricting new contract or program starts and additional government shutdowns, which might involve all government agencies, could arise. In addition, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain unless the Budget Control Act is repealed or significantly modified."

We generally are able to recover these contributions related to our plans as allowable costs on our U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, but there is a lag between when we contribute cash to our plans under pension funding rules and recover it under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). Effective February 2012, the CAS rules were revised to harmonize the measurement and period assignment of the pension cost allocable to government contracts with the PPA (CAS Harmonization). Following the five year transition period, CAS Harmonization was fully phased in during 2017, this better aligns the CAS pension cost and ERISA funding requirements. The enactment of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 increased the interest rate assumption used to determine our CAS pension costs and ERISA funding requirements. This has the effect of lowering both the recovery of pension contributions, as it decreases our CAS pension costs, and our ERISA funding requirements during the affected periods."

Changes in procurement policy favoring more incentive-based fee arrangements, different award fee criteria or government contract negotiation offers based upon the customer\u2019s view of what our costs should be (as compared to our actual costs) may affect the predictability of our profit rates. Our customers are subject to pressures that may result in a change in contract types referenced above earlier in a program\u2019s maturity than is traditional. An example of this is the use of fixed-price incentive-fee contracts for recent LRIP contracts on the F-35 program while the development contract is being performed concurrently. Our customers also may pursue non-traditional contract provisions in negotiation of contracts. For example, changes resulting from the F-35 development contract may need to be implemented on the production contracts (including the LRIP contracts), a concept referred to as concurrency, which may require us to pay for a portion of the concurrency costs. In some circumstances, the U.S. Government is proposing positions that are inconsistent with the FAR and existing practice. For example, the U.S. Government is now requiring that bid and proposal costs be included in general and administrative costs, rather than charged directly to contracts in certain circumstances. Another example is a recent challenge to overhead costs. The U.S. Government\u2019s pursuit of policies intended to cause us to absorb cost may become more aggressive if the U.S. Government concludes that our profitability justifies cost shifting without regard to the provisions of the FAR."

The FAR and DFARS provide that the U.S. government obtains certain rights in intellectual property, including patents, developed by us and our subcontractors and suppliers in performance of government contracts or with government funding. The U.S. government may use or authorize others, including competitors, to use such intellectual property. Non-U.S. governments may also have certain rights in patents and other intellectual property developed in performance of our contracts with these entities. The U.S. government is taking increasingly aggressive positions regarding the types of intellectual property to which government use rights apply and when it is appropriate for the government to insist on broad use rights. The DoD is also developing an overarching intellectual property acquisition policy that will require a greater focus and planning as to intellectual property rights for its programs, and we have no assurance as to the potential impacts of this policy or any associated regulatory changes on future acquisitions. The DoD\u2019s efforts could affect our ability to protect and exploit our intellectual property and to leverage supplier intellectual property, for example, if we are unable to obtain necessary licenses from our suppliers to meet government requirements. Additionally, while we take measures to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and to respect the intellectual property rights of others, our intellectual property and intellectual property licensed or obtained from third parties is subject to challenges (such as infringement and misappropriation claims) by third parties, which could adversely affect our ability to compete and perform on contracts."

The underlying budget impasse remains, and it is possible that there will be a further partial shutdown or shutdowns. As noted above, while the corporation\u2019s largest customer, the DoD, is funded through the end of the government FY 2019 and thus would not be affected by another shutdown, limiting the direct impact of any future shutdown or shutdowns on Lockheed Martin, other customers, such as NASA, are not. In the event of future shutdowns, we may continue to work on unfunded contracts to seek to maintain their projected cost and schedule profiles which, although we would anticipate being paid when the shutdown ends, would put us at risk of nonpayment. Further there may be indirect impacts such as the potential diversion of funds from the DoD and the fact that the Departments of State and Commerce cease to timely process export licenses. While in the recent shutdown there were procedures in place to process on an emergency basis licenses involving direct support to the military, humanitarian aid, or other similar emergencies, there was a growing backlog of non-emergency applications. We anticipate that this will occur again in any future shutdown. While the impact on Lockheed Martin of the recent shutdown was not material, were a future shutdown to occur and continue for an extended period, this might not be the case. In addition, the President has not yet submitted a budget proposal for FY 2020 to Congress. If an annual appropriations bill is not enacted for FY 2020 or beyond, the U.S. Government may operate under a continuing resolution, restricting new contract or program starts and additional government shutdowns, which might involve all government agencies, could arise. In addition, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain unless the Budget Control Act is repealed or significantly modified."

For example, beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years. If these provisions are not deferred, modified, or repealed by Congress with retroactive effect to January 1, 2022, they will materially decrease our cash from operations beginning in 2022. We currently estimate an approximately $500 million impact to 2022 cash from operations based on the provisions currently in effect. The actual impact on 2022 cash from operations will depend on if and when these provisions are deferred, modified, or repealed by Congress, including if retroactively, and the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2022 among other factors. In addition, recent proposals to increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate would require us to increase our net deferred tax assets upon enactment of new tax legislation, with a corresponding material, one-time, noncash decrease in income tax expense, but our income tax expense and payments would likely be materially increased in subsequent years. See \"Consolidated Results of Operations - Income Tax Expense\" in the MD&A for additional detail on the potential effect of tax rate increases. In addition to future changes in tax laws, the amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans, and future changes in tax laws. In addition, we are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows."

          "text": "Fixed-price contracts are predominantly either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we generally share with the U.S. Government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price. We carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under FPI contracts. Due to the fixed-price nature of the contracts, if our actual costs exceed our estimates, our margins and profits are reduced and we could incur a reach-forward loss. A reach-forward loss is when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price. When this occurs, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident."

A decision by the U.S. Government or international partner and FMS customer countries to cut spending on this program or reduce or delay planned orders would have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program and delivery schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international countries\u2019 oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include our and our suppliers\u2019 performance (including COVID-19 performance-related challenges), software development, definitizing and receiving funding for contracts on a timely basis, execution of future flight tests and findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft, the level of cost associated with life cycle operations and sustainment, inflation-related cost pressures and the ability to continue to improve affordability. Our planned production rates and deliveries have been adversely affected and could continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 or supplier performance challenges, which affect our results of operations. For example, during 2022, we experienced a temporary halt of F-35 deliveries due to non-compliant materials in a component provided by a supplier, which affected timing of deliveries. Additionally, as described in the \u201cStatus of the F-35 Program\u201d in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we are experiencing a pause in aircraft deliveries due to the suspension of Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) engine deliveries and corresponding flight restrictions that were issued by the U.S. Government. If not resolved in a timely manner, this could impact our results of operations and cash flows. See also the Risk Factor below captioned \u201cWe are heavily dependent on suppliers and if our subcontractors or other suppliers or teaming agreement or joint venture partners fail to perform their obligations, our performance and ability to win future business could be adversely affected\u201d for a discussion of the risk of non-compliant parts and the supply chain."

Closing of the transaction is subject, among other things, to expiration of any waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (which now has expired), and any other period in which the parties have agreed not to close. On January 11, 2022, the parties provided an updated notice of their intended closing date under their timing agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), whereby the parties agreed that they would not close the transaction before January 27, 2022, to enable the parties to discuss the scope and nature of the merchant supply and firewall commitments previously offered to the FTC by Lockheed Martin. We have been advised by the FTC that its concerns regarding the transaction cannot be addressed adequately by the terms of a consent order. We believe it is highly likely that the FTC will vote to sue to block the transaction and expect they will make a decision before January 27, 2022. If the FTC sues to block the transaction, we could elect to defend the lawsuit within 30 days or terminate the merger agreement. If the FTC does not file a lawsuit to block the transaction before January 27, 2022, the parties could proceed to close the transaction, but there is no assurance that the FTC would not file a lawsuit challenging the transaction after the closing since the parties have not reached agreement on the terms of a consent order. A post-closing lawsuit could include taking action to seek a declaration that the acquisition is unlawful and to seek divestiture of all or part of the Aerojet Rocketdyne business or to enjoin integration of the Aerojet Rocketdyne business with Lockheed Martin\u2019s business. There is no assurance that we would be successful in any litigation with the FTC, whether before or after closing."

Although existing export licenses are not subject to the current sanctions, we continue to expect pending and future export licensing applications and any required modifications, extensions or changes in scope to the existing licenses where SSB or any of certain affiliated persons is a party to the underlying transaction to be denied, which denials would adversely affect our ability to perform the impacted contracts. For example, since April 2021, we have received multiple denials from the U.S. Department of State for export, import and manufacturing licenses pertaining to TUHP. These denials prevent us from performing certain significant obligations under contracts for TUHP, which has and will affect our sales and impact our ability to recover certain costs. As a result of these license denials, we have provided force majeure notices under the affected contracts and these contracts may be restructured or terminated, which could result in a further reduction in sales, the imposition of penalties or assessment of damages, and increased unrecoverable costs. In addition, we have other programs where we work with Turkish industry, including for domestic U.S. Black Hawk\u00ae helicopter production, that rely on components from Turkish suppliers. While these commercial relationships are not affected by the current sanctions, they could be adversely affected by the imposition of additional sanctions."
