There are only a limited number of customers who are successfully exploiting this new business model paradigm.\nAlso, in order to respond to the new business model paradigm, we have seen the changes of nature in our customers\u0092 business models. For example, there is a growing trend toward the rise of system houses that operate in a manner which make their\nproducts and services more marketable in a changing consumer market. Also, since the global semiconductor industry is becoming increasingly competitive, some of our customers have engaged in industry consolidations in order to remain competitive.\nSuch consolidations have taken the form of mergers and acquisitions.

The loss of, or significant curtailment of purchases by, one or more\nof our top customers, including curtailments due to increased competitive pressures, industry consolidation, a change in their designs, or change in their manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or\ndistributor inventory adjustments, or change in our major customers\u0092 business models may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition."

In the past, shortages in the supply of some materials, whether by specific vendors or by the semiconductor industry generally, have resulted\nin occasional industry-wide price adjustments and delivery delays. For example, the recent increase in silicon wafer prices due to increased demand for such wafers across industry is expected to negatively impact our gross margin in 2017. In\naddition, major natural disasters, political or economic turmoil occurring within the country of origin of such raw materials may also significantly disrupt the availability of such raw materials or increase their prices. Also, since we procure some\nof our raw materials from sole-source suppliers, there is a risk that our need for such raw materials may not be met or that back-up supplies may not be readily available. Our revenue and earnings could decline if we are unable to obtain adequate\nsupplies of the necessary raw materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of raw materials that we cannot pass on to our customers."

We compete by developing process technologies using increasingly\nadvanced nodes and on manufacturing products with more functions. We also compete by developing new derivative technologies. If we do not anticipate these changes in technologies and rapidly develop new and innovative technologies, or our\ncompetitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to additional technologies, we may not be able to provide foundry services on competitive terms. In addition, our customers have significantly decreased the time in which their products or services are\nlaunched into the market. If we are unable to meet these shorter product\ntime-to-market,\nwe risk losing these customers. These factors have also been intensified by the\nshift of the global technology market to consumer driven products such as mobile devices, and increasing concentration of customers and competition (all further discussed among these risk factors). Also, the uncertainty and instability inherent in\nadvanced technologies also impose challenges for achieving expected product quality and product yield. If we fail to maintain quality, it may result in loss of revenue and additional cost, as well as loss of business or customer trust. For example,\nin January 2019, we discovered the yield problems in\n12-\nand\n16-nanometer\nwafers caused by a batch of photoresist, which resulted in delayed delivery of products and are\nexpected to have a negative effect on our gross margin and operating margin.

As of the date of this annual report, our current business and results of operations have not been materially\naffected by the pandemic. However, depending on unfolding developments of the pandemic, we could face various risks, including those identified here and others. As the pandemic is still ongoing and may worsen, there is significant uncertainty\nsurrounding its developments and impacts, including whether the current epidemic or continued spread of\nCOVID-19\nwill cause an economic slowdown or a global recession, and we cannot predict at this time the\nimpact it will have on our business or results of operations."

We responded with counter-lawsuits against GF for patent infringement in September 2019 targeting its manufacturing activities in the U.S., Germany, and\nSingapore. Shortly after, we reached an agreement with GF in October 2019 to dismiss all litigation between the parties, as well as those that involve any of our customers.

Most of our production facilities, as well as those of many of our suppliers, customers and upstream providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services, are located in areas susceptible to natural disasters and may face potential shortages of electricity or water, which could cause interruptions to our operations. On April 3, 2024, an earthquake struck Taiwan. The resulting damage was mostly to inventories and equipment. Based on a preliminary assessment, we estimated that related earthquake losses will be approximately NT$3 billion, net of insurance claim, and will be recognized in the second quarter of 2024."

Some of these incidents have resulted in interruptions to our operations. Such outages, shortages or interruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy of the governments. If we are unable to secure reliable and uninterrupted supply of electricity to power our manufacturing fabs, our ability to fill customers\u2019 orders would be jeopardized. Moreover, we have encountered and may continue to encounter increases in the prices of utilities. For example, effective from April 1, 2024, we are subject to a higher electricity tariff rate in Taiwan, which is estimated to increase by 25%, as compared to the tariff rate applicable to us in 2023. The increased prices for electricity could increase our manufacturing costs and therefore adversely impact our financial results."

          "text": "The semiconductor industry and its technologies are constantly changing. We compete by developing process technologies using increasingly advanced nodes and manufacturing products with more functions. We also compete by developing new derivative technologies. If we do not anticipate these changes in technologies and rapidly develop new and innovative technologies, or our competitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to additional technologies, we may not be able to provide foundry services on competitive terms. For example, the global surge in the development of artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) has had a significant impact on customer demand for advanced semiconductor chips and the market dynamics in our industry; thus, our ability to continuously develop relevant technologies, products and services to meet these customer needs will be critical for us to effectively compete in this space. We also believe that the effective use of AI in our internal operations is important to our long-term success. As the AI technologies are rapidly evolving, if we are unable to deploy new AI technologies in our internal operations as effectively as our competitors, it may hurt our competitive position. In addition, our customers have significantly decreased the time in which their products or services are launched into the market. If we are unable to meet these shorter product\ntime-to-market,\nwe risk losing these customers. These factors have also been intensified by the shift of the global technology market to consumer driven products, such as smartphones, and increasing competition and concentration of customers (all further discussed among these risk factors). Also, the uncertainty and instability inherent in advanced technologies impose challenges for achieving expected product quality and product yield. If we fail to maintain quality, it may result in loss of revenue and additional cost, as well as loss of business or customer trust. If we are unable to overcome the above factors, we may become less competitive and our revenue may decline significantly."

We have implemented and continually update rigorous cybersecurity measures to prevent and minimize harm caused by such attacks. Such measures include advanced virus scanning tools to protect fab equipment, strengthening firewall and network controls to prevent computer viruses from spreading among tools and fabs, installing advanced malware defense solutions for critical computers, introducing new solution architecture to secure internet access, adopting advanced solutions against distributed\ndenial-of-service\nattacks from the internet, introducing new technology for data protection, enhancing and certifying office computer security compliance, improving email phishing defense and implementing employee awareness testing. We also established an integrated and automatic security operation platform, enabled the automation of cybersecurity event detection and response, enhanced internal security assessment automation, conducted external red team testing and practiced responses to ransomware attacks. For supply chain risks reduction, through collaboration, we helped major suppliers improve their security maturity and share industry security events and best practices on demand and by schedule. Moreover, we have collaborated with Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute (\u201cSEMI\u201d) to set up a Semiconductor Cybersecurity Committee to promote security standards (SEMI E187) as well as security assessment methodology for improving the resilience of semiconductor supply chain. While these ongoing enhancements further improve our cybersecurity defense solutions, there can be no assurance that we are immune to cyberattacks."
