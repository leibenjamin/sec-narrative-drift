In addition, we have operations worldwide and a significant percentage of our revenue comes from sales to locations outside the R.O.C. Operating in the R.O.C. and overseas exposes us to changes in policies and laws, as well as the general political, economic and social conditions, outbreak of war or hostilities, terrorism, trade disputes, security risks, social unrests, protests, strikes, health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks, in the various countries in which we operate, which could result in an adverse effect on our business operations in such countries and our results of operations as well as the market price and the liquidity of our ADSs and common shares. Any major change in economic, fiscal and/or trade policies in the U.S. from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenues or in another major jurisdiction could severely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, any U.S. law or government incentive policy that encourages our U.S. customers to relocate their manufacturing capacity or supply chain to the U.S. or require their respective contractors, subcontractors and relevant agents to do so could impair our ability to sustain our current level of productivity and manufacturing efficiency. Our business model is intertwined with an ecosystem of semiconductor suppliers in the R.O.C. that permits thousands of our engineers and other relevant personnel to commute from one manufacturing site to another for purposes of refining specific designs and manufacturing processes in a timely manner. These advantages permit us to operate our manufacturing fabs efficiently and resolve any technical or commercial difficulties quickly to maintain our competitive edge. If these advantages are impaired or lost, we may be unable to sustain our current ability to supply our customers with goods and services at the current level of cost, quality, quantity and delivery schedule to which our customers have been accustomed."

          "text": "Over the years, our customer profile and the nature of our customers' business have changed dramatically. While we generate revenue from hundreds of customers worldwide, our ten largest customers in 2014, 2015, and 2016 accounted for approximately 63%, 63% and 69% of our net revenue in the respective year. Our largest customer in 2014, 2015, and 2016 accounted for 21%, 16% and 17% of our net revenue in the respective year. Our second largest customer in 2014, 2015, and 2016 accounted for 9%, 16% and 11% of our net revenue in the respective year. A more concentrated customer base will subject our revenue to seasonal demand fluctuations from our large customers, and cause different seasonal patterns of our business. This customer concentration results in part from the changing dynamics of the electronics industry with the structural shift to mobile devices and applications and software that provide the content for such devices. There are only a limited number of customers who are successfully exploiting this new business model paradigm. Also, in order to respond to the new business model paradigm, we have seen the changes of nature in our customers' business models. For example, there is a growing trend toward the rise of system houses that operate in a manner which make their products and services more marketable in a changing consumer market. Also, since the global semiconductor industry is becoming increasingly competitive, some of our customers have engaged in industry consolidations in order to remain competitive. Such consolidations have taken the form of mergers and acquisitions. If more of our major customers consolidate, this will further decrease the overall number of our customer pool. The loss of, or significant curtailment of purchases by, one or more of our top customers, including curtailments due to increased competitive pressures, industry consolidation, a change in their designs, or change in their manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, or change in our major customers' business models may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition."

          "text": "Our production operations require that we obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, gases, chemicals, and photoresist, on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices. In the past, shortages in the supply of some materials, whether by specific vendors or by the semiconductor industry generally, have resulted in occasional industry-wide price adjustments and delivery delays. For example, the recent increase in silicon wafer prices due to increased demand for such wafers across industry is expected to negatively impact our gross margin in 2017. In addition, major natural disasters, political or economic turmoil occurring within the country of origin of such raw materials may also significantly disrupt the availability of such raw materials or increase their prices. Also, since we procure some of our raw materials from sole-source suppliers, there is a risk that our need for such raw materials may not be met or that back-up supplies may not be readily available. Our revenue and earnings could decline if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of the necessary raw materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of raw materials that we cannot pass on to our customers."

Our semiconductor foundry business is affected by market conditions in such highly cyclical electronics and semiconductor industries. Variations in order levels from our customers may result in volatility in our revenues and earnings. From time to time, the electronics and semiconductor industries have experienced significant and sometimes prolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity. Because we are, and will continue to be, dependent on the requirements of electronics and semiconductor companies for our services, periods of downturns and overcapacity in the general electronics and semiconductor industries could lead to reduced demand for overall semiconductor foundry services, including our services. If we cannot take appropriate actions such as reducing our costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand, our revenues, margin and earnings will suffer during periods of downturns and overcapacity."

In August 2018, we experienced a computer virus outbreak, which caused the malfunction of a number of our computer systems and fab tools in Taiwan and interrupted the operations of certain equipment. The virus incident was due to a misoperation by our staff when installing a new equipment that contained malicious software unknown to us. Also, our firewall controls did not effectively prevent the software from propagating. While neither data integrity nor confidential information were compromised, the incident caused shipment delays and a loss of NT$2,596 million (US$85 million) classified as the cost of revenue in the third quarter of 2018. Remedial actions have since been taken, such as implementation of an automated system to prevent unprotected tool installation, and strengthening of firewall and network control to prevent computer viruses from spreading among tools and fabs, and enhancements to further improve our protection against malicious software are ongoing. We have additionally budgeted an adequate amount for IT security solution enhancement. However, there can be no assurance that we are no longer subject to malicious software attacks."

          "text": "The semiconductor industry and its technologies are constantly changing. We compete by developing process technologies using increasingly advanced nodes and on manufacturing products with more functions. We also compete by developing new derivative technologies. If we do not anticipate these changes in technologies and rapidly develop new and innovative technologies, or our competitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to additional technologies, we may not be able to provide foundry services on competitive terms. In addition, our customers have significantly decreased the time in which their products or services are launched into the market. If we are unable to meet these shorter product time-to-market, we risk losing these customers. These factors have also been intensified by the shift of the global technology market to consumer driven products such as mobile devices, and increasing concentration of customers and competition (all further discussed among these risk factors). Also, the uncertainty and instability inherent in advanced technologies also impose challenges for achieving expected product quality and product yield. If we fail to maintain quality, it may result in loss of revenue and additional cost, as well as loss of business or customer trust. For example, in January 2019, we discovered the yield problems in 12- and 16-nanometer wafers caused by a batch of photoresist, which resulted in delayed delivery of products and are expected to have a negative effect on our gross margin and operating margin. We have strengthened inline wafer inspection and tightened control of incoming material to deal with the increasing complexity of leading-edge technologies. If we are unable to innovate new technologies that meet the demands of our customers or overcome the above factors, we may become less competitive and our revenue may decline significantly."

Expectations of high inflation or deflation each adversely affects the economy, at both macro and micro levels, by reducing economic efficiency and disrupting investment decisions. Recently, higher interest rates in the U.S., international trade tensions, and the possible changes in economic, fiscal and monetary policies in major economies have exacerbated, and may further exacerbate, fluctuations in inflationary or deflationary expectations. Such volatility may negatively affect the costs of our operations and the business operations of our customers who may be forced to plan their purchases of our goods and services within an uncertain economy. Therefore, the demand for our products and services could unexpectedly fluctuate severely in accordance with expectations of inflation or deflation as affected by market volatility.

In August 2018, we experienced a computer virus outbreak, which caused the malfunction of a number of our computer systems and fab tools in Taiwan and interrupted the operations of certain equipment. The virus incident was due to a misoperation by our staff when installing a new equipment that contained malicious software unknown to us. Also, our firewall controls did not effectively prevent the software from propagating. While neither data integrity nor confidential information were compromised, the incident caused shipment delays and a loss of NT$2,596 million (US$85 million) classified as the cost of revenue in the third quarter of 2018. Remedial actions have since been taken, such as implementation of an automated system to prevent unprotected tool installation, and strengthening of firewall and network control to prevent computer viruses from spreading among tools and fabs, and enhancements to further improve our protection against malicious software are ongoing. We have additionally budgeted an adequate amount for IT security solution enhancement. However, there can be no assurance that we are no longer subject to malicious software attacks."

These assertions have at times resulted in litigation. Because of the nature of the industry and our market position, we may continue to receive such communications in the future. We continue to face a number of assertions made and lawsuits initiated by litigious, well-funded, non-practicing entities who are aggressive in their monetary demand and in seeking court-issued injunctions. We also encounter, from time-to-time, assertions and litigations initiated by semiconductor companies seeking to disrupt our business such as the patent infringement lawsuits in August 2019 filed by GlobalFoundries (\"GF\") attempting to restrict our and our customers' activities in the United States and Germany. We responded with counter-lawsuits against GF for patent infringement in September 2019 targeting its manufacturing activities in the U.S., Germany, and Singapore. Shortly after, we reached an agreement with GF in October 2019 to dismiss all litigation between the parties, as well as those that involve any of our customers. Such lawsuits and assertions may increase our cost of doing business and may potentially be extremely disruptive if these asserting entities succeed in blocking the trade of products made and services offered by us. See \"Item 8. Financial Information \u2013 Legal Proceedings\" for a further discussion. Also, as we expanded our manufacturing operations into certain non-R.O.Cjurisdictions, we have faced increasing challenges to manage risks of intellectual property misappropriation. Despite our efforts to adopt robust measures to mitigate the risk of intellectual property misappropriation in such new jurisdictions, we cannot guarantee that the protection measures we adopted will be sufficient to prevent us from potential infringements by others, or at all."

Most of our production facilities, as well as those of many of our suppliers, customers and upstream providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services, are located in areas susceptible to natural disasters and may face potential shortages of electricity or water, which could cause interruptions to our operations. On April 3, 2024, an earthquake struck Taiwan. The resulting damage was mostly to inventories and equipment. Based on a preliminary assessment, we estimated that related earthquake losses will be approximately NT$3 billion, net of insurance claim, and will be recognized in the second quarter of 2024."

          "text": "We have occasionally suffered power outages, dips or surges caused by difficulties encountered by our electricity supplier or other power consumers on the same power grid. Some of these incidents have resulted in interruptions to our operations. Such outages, shortages or interruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy of the governments. If we are unable to secure reliable and uninterrupted supply of electricity to power our manufacturing fabs, our ability to fill customers\u2019 orders would be jeopardized. Moreover, we have encountered and may continue to encounter increases in the prices of utilities. For example, effective from April 1, 2024, we are subject to a higher electricity tariff rate in Taiwan, which is estimated to increase by 25%, as compared to the tariff rate applicable to us in 2023. The increased prices for electricity could increase our manufacturing costs and therefore adversely impact our financial results."

          "text": "The semiconductor industry and its technologies are constantly changing. We compete by developing process technologies using increasingly advanced nodes and manufacturing products with more functions. We also compete by developing new derivative technologies. If we do not anticipate these changes in technologies and rapidly develop new and innovative technologies, or our competitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to additional technologies, we may not be able to provide foundry services on competitive terms. For example, the global surge in the development of artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) has had a significant impact on customer demand for advanced semiconductor chips and the market dynamics in our industry; thus, our ability to continuously develop relevant technologies, products and services to meet these customer needs will be critical for us to effectively compete in this space. We also believe that the effective use of AI in our internal operations is important to our long-term success. As the AI technologies are rapidly evolving, if we are unable to deploy new AI technologies in our internal operations as effectively as our competitors, it may hurt our competitive position. In addition, our customers have significantly decreased the time in which their products or services are launched into the market. If we are unable to meet these shorter product time-to-market, we risk losing these customers. These factors have also been intensified by the shift of the global technology market to consumer driven products, such as smartphones, and increasing competition and concentration of customers (all further discussed among these risk factors). Also, the uncertainty and instability inherent in advanced technologies impose challenges for achieving expected product quality and product yield. If we fail to maintain quality, it may result in loss of revenue and additional cost, as well as loss of business or customer trust. If we are unable to overcome the above factors, we may become less competitive and our revenue may decline significantly."

          "text": "In the past, we experienced and may in the future be subject to attack by malicious software. We have implemented and continually update rigorous cybersecurity measures to prevent and minimize harm caused by such attacks. Such measures include advanced virus scanning tools to protect fab equipment, strengthening firewall and network controls to prevent computer viruses from spreading among tools and fabs, installing advanced malware defense solutions for critical computers, introducing new solution architecture to secure internet access, adopting advanced solutions against distributed denial-of-service attacks from the internet, introducing new technology for data protection, enhancing and certifying office computer security compliance, improving email phishing defense and implementing employee awareness testing. We also established an integrated and automatic security operation platform, enabled the automation of cybersecurity event detection and response, enhanced internal security assessment automation, conducted external red team testing and practiced responses to ransomware attacks. For supply chain risks reduction, through collaboration, we helped major suppliers improve their security maturity and share industry security events and best practices on demand and by schedule. Moreover, we have collaborated with Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute (\u201cSEMI\u201d) to set up a Semiconductor Cybersecurity Committee to promote security standards (SEMI E187) as well as security assessment methodology for improving the resilience of semiconductor supply chain. While these ongoing enhancements further improve our cybersecurity defense solutions, there can be no assurance that we are immune to cyberattacks."

Nevertheless, we could still face the post-pandemic downward changes in consumers\u2019 demand for electronic products which in turn lead to reduced demand for and place downward pressure on the price of our products and services."

          "text": "Our role in the semiconductor supply chain inherently limits our visibility and information available to us regarding the downstream use or user of final products that incorporate semiconductors manufactured by us. This constraint impedes our ability to fully ensure that semiconductors manufactured by us will not be diverted to unintended end use or end-user, including potentially by our business partners, or by third parties with an intent of circumvention. In addition, if we or our business partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits or are found to have violated applicable export control or sanctions laws, we may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences, including government investigations and penalties resulting from relevant legal proceedings, as described in the above paragraph. In October 2024, we notified relevant U.S. and Taiwan authorities that one type of our customer\u2019s chip manufactured by us might have been diverted to a restricted entity or incorporated into a restricted entity\u2019s product, and since then have been cooperating with the authorities\u2019 requests for additional information and documents. Despite our best efforts to comply with all relevant export control and sanctions laws and regulations, there is no assurance that our business activities will not be found incompliant with export control laws and regulations."

An important aspect of our business operation is an ecosystem of interconnected semiconductor fabs, employees and suppliers in the R.O.C. that provides us with significant operational synergies, flexibility and efficiencies. For example, we are able to temporarily reassign thousands of our engineers and other relevant personnel from one manufacturing site to another to refine specific designs and adapt manufacturing processes in a timely manner. These advantages permit us to operate our manufacturing fabs efficiently and resolve any technical or commercial difficulties quickly to maintain our competitive edge. Restrictions on our ability to transfer people among our operations in the R.O.C., the United States, the P.R.C., Japan, and Europe efficiently due to challenges such as regional employment rules and regulations, and immigration or travel restrictions, may impair or reduce these advantages, and we may not be able to sustain our current ability to supply our customers with goods and services at the current level of cost, quality, quantity and delivery schedule to which our customers have been accustomed."

The R.O.C. Controlled Foreign Company (\u201cCFC\u201d) rules enacted in 2016 have been implemented since January 1, 2023, pursuant to which, certain profits retained at a CFC located in a low-taxjurisdiction would be taxable at its parent company in Taiwan. Further, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project that was undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d). These changes may increase tax uncertainty and have an adverse effect on our operating results. See \u201cItem 5.

While we generate revenue from hundreds of customers worldwide, our ten largest customers in 2021, 2022 and 2023 accounted for approximately, 71%, 68% and 70% of our net revenue in the respective year. Our largest customer in 2021, 2022 and 2023 accounted for 26%, 23% and 25% of our net revenue in the respective year. Our second largest customer in 2021, 2022 and 2023 accounted for 10%, less than 10% and 11% of our net revenue in the respective year. A more concentrated customer base will subject our revenue to seasonal demand fluctuations from our large customers and cause different seasonal patterns in our business. This customer concentration results in part from the changing dynamics of the electronics industry with the structural shift to mobile and high performance computing devices and applications and software that provide the content for such devices."
