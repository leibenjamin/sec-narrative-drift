In certain locations in the U.S and around the world with COVID-19 outbreaks, we temporarily halted in-person interactions by our employees with healthcare providers and increased virtual interactions. While in-person interactions have resumed in many locations, we may decide to halt such activity in the future and, in those cases, expect to resume such interactions as it is safe to do so and in compliance with applicable guidance and requirements. The COVID-19 pandemic could also have an adverse impact on our manufacturing operations, global supply chain, and distribution systems, which could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products and affect the ability of third parties on which we rely to fulfill their obligations to us, and could increase our expenses."

Expedited authorization processes, including our EUAs for bamlanivimab and bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together, have allowed restricted distribution of products with less than typical safety and efficacy data, and additional data that become available may call into question the safety or effectiveness of our COVID-19 therapies. Additionally, the availability of superior or competitive therapies, or preventative measures such as vaccines, coupled with the transient nature of pandemics, could negatively impact or eliminate demand for our COVID-19 therapies. In addition, we may be required to accept returns of certain product previously shipped pursuant to EUAs if the relevant EUA is revoked or terminated. Mutations or the spread of other variants of the coronavirus could also render our therapies ineffective. Any of these risks could prevent us from recouping our substantial investments in the research, development, and manufacture of our COVID-19 therapies."

The foregoing risks may be heightened in jurisdictions outside the U.S., where we may have fewer alternative providers as well as face additional costs, uncertainties, and risks. Among other third-party providers, we, and the pharmaceutical industry generally, depend on China-based suppliers for portions of our supply chain. U.S. officials are increasingly considering legislation or other actions that are intended to limit supply chain reliance on China, including the BIOSECURE Act. In February 2025, the U.S. presidential administration imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded with tariffs on select U.S. goods. If enacted, additional measures could result in supply disruptions or delays, increase costs more significantly, or invite further retaliatory measures, any of which could negatively impact our business.

Among other risks, the use of tariffs and other trade restrictions increase costs and may impact clinical trials or sales of our products, or otherwise complicate aspects of our business. In particular, tensions between the U.S. and China, which have already led to a series of tariffs and sanctions, as well as other business restrictions, could further escalate based on additional trade restrictions or retaliation thereto. In February 2025, the U.S. presidential administration imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded with tariffs on select U.S. goods. Additionally, tariffs were proposed or threatened with respect to other jurisdictions, including Mexico, Canada and Europe. If geopolitical tensions were to increase and disrupt our operations in, or related to, China or other major international geographies, such disruption would significantly impact our business. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\u2014Risks Related to Our Operations\u2014Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business,\" for additional information. As a further example, the financial impact of higher energy prices, defense spending, and geopolitical and economic disruptions, has further exacerbated financial pressures on governments with single-payer or government funded healthcare systems, leading to increased impetus for increases in rebates, clawbacks, and other reforms to reimbursement systems, particularly in Europe. These and similar events have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, us, our business partners, and our customers.

          "text": "We also face challenges from the distribution of counterfeit and illegally compounded versions of our genuine drugs, including as related to our products with GLP-1 receptor agonist activity. Counterfeits, and in some cases illegally compounded drugs, fraudulently claim to be, or claim to contain, genuine branded medicines. Counterfeit and illegally compounded drugs may not have the same safety, quality, and effectiveness as approved drugs, and may pose serious health risks to patients. Our reputation and business could suffer harm from counterfeit or illegally compounded drugs and our actions to stop or prevent illegal sales of such drugs may be costly or ineffective."

          "text": "We rely on third parties, including suppliers, distributors, alliances, and collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and third-party service providers, for selected aspects of product and clinical development, manufacturing, commercialization, hosting of, and support for, IT systems, product distribution, and certain financial transactional processes. As examples, we outsource the day-to-day management and oversight of some of our clinical trials to contract research organizations, certain active ingredient manufacturing, finishing operations, and device or component production and assembly to contract manufacturing organizations, and the distribution of our products through logistics providers. In some cases, product or indication approvals depend on the outcome of regulatory inspections of third parties on which we rely. For example, in September 2023, the FDA issued a complete response letter for our lebrikizumab BLA for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. In the letter, the FDA cited findings that arose during a multi-sponsor inspection of a third-party, contract manufacturing organization that included the monoclonal antibody drug substance for lebrikizumab. We may encounter similar difficulties in the future, which could delay or prevent product launches and otherwise negatively affect our business, results, and reputation."

          "text": "Also in the U.S., in addition to the process for challenging patents set forth in the BPCIA, which applies to biologic products, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides generic companies substantial incentives to seek to invalidate our patents covering small molecule pharmaceutical products. As a result, we expect that our U.S. patents on major pharmaceutical products, including biologics, will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation and may not be upheld. In addition, a separate IPR process currently allows competitors to seek invalidation of patents at the USPTO without the protections of the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act. The use of IPR proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act is currently a topic of debate among legislators and the future ability of our competitors to use IPR proceedings as an alternative to Hatch-Waxman Act or BPCIA litigation procedures to challenge our patents remains uncertain. The USPTO issued an interim procedure regarding the use of discretionary denials of IPR proceedings when there is parallel district court litigation. However, it is not clear how this interim procedure could affect the ability of our competitors to institute IPR proceedings after institution of litigation. If our patents are challenged through this expedited review process, even if we prevail in demonstrating the validity of our patent, our win provides limited precedential value at the PTAB and no precedential value in federal district court, meaning the same patent can be challenged by other competitors."
