On July 20, 2015 the FRB published a final order that applies enhanced prudential standards to GE Capital as a nonbank SIFI. The final order staggers the application of the enhanced prudential standards with the first set of standards becoming applicable on January 1, 2016 and the second set becoming applicable on January 1, 2018. Under the standards applicable on January 1, 2016 GE Capital became subject to the FRB's capital adequacy framework using the standardized approach to calculate risk-weighted assets, as well as to the maintenance of a 90% liquidity coverage ratio until December 31, 2016 and a 100% ratio thereafter. If GE Capital is still a nonbank SIFI on January 1, 2018 the second set of enhanced prudential standards will apply. These standards would include stress testing and capital planning requirements under the FRB's more formal comprehensive capital analysis and review (CCAR) regulations, enhanced leverage ratio requirements, enhanced governance requirements, daily liquidity calculations, additional reporting requirements and a market terms requirement for transactions between GE and GE Capital. GE Capital plans to file an application with the FSOC in early 2016 to terminate the FSOC's designation of GE Capital as a nonbank SIFI, but the timeline for the FSOC to act on the application will be uncertain and a favorable FSOC decision is not assured. Until the FSOC approves the termination of GE Capital's designation as a nonbank SIFI, GE Capital will remain subject to regulatory requirements and, depending on the timing of favorable FSOC action, may need to delay planned cost reductions and potential capital distributions."

These assumptions include, but are not limited to, interest rates, health care experience (including type and cost of care), morbidity, mortality, the length of time a policy will remain in force and anticipated future premium increases from future in-force rate actions. Assumptions are locked-in throughout the life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops at which time we change these assumptions to reflect our most recent assumptions. Our annual premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of capitalized acquisition costs, using our most recent assumptions. Liabilities for investment contracts equal the account value, that is, the amount that accrues to the benefit of the contract or policyholder including credited interest and assessments through the financial statement date."

Our policy under ASC 605 was to defer recognition until all risk had transferred to the customer, which was generally upon product installation or customer acceptance. For these equipment contracts, the customer has control of the equipment in advance of the related installation or acceptance event based on our evaluation of the indicators provided in ASC 606. Consistent with our industry peers, certain of our businesses\u2019 products have transitioned either to a point in time or over time recognition based on the nature of the arrangement.

The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account deducted from the amortized cost basis of the assets to present their net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected. Each period the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through earnings to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining lives of the assets. We evaluate debt securities with unrealized losses to determine whether any of the losses arise from concerns about the issuer\u2019s credit or the underlying collateral and record an allowance for credit losses, if required."

The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the separation transactions for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring at all.

These procedures included updating certain experience studies since our last test completed in the third quarter of 2021, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. Using updated assumptions, the 2022 premium deficiency testing results indicated a positive margin of about\n10\n% of the related future policy benefit reserves recorded at September 30, 2022, or approximately equivalent to the 2021 premium deficiency testing results. The premium deficiency testing margin in 2022 was impacted by a lower discount rate in our ERAC portfolio due to the recapture transaction, as explained above, partially offset by higher prevailing benchmark interest rates in the U.S. The portfolio of investment securities expected to be received from the recapture transaction were assumed to be invested at yields below ERAC\u2019s current portfolio yield before ultimately grading to the long-term average investment yield as we reinvest the portfolio over time. This effect was partially offset by the net impact from assumed moderately higher near-term mortality related to COVID-19 in the aggregate across our run-off insurance products (i.e., for life insurance products, higher mortality increases the present value of expected future benefit payments, while for annuity and long-term care insurance contracts, higher mortality decreases the present value of expected future benefit payments). Excluding the net impact from assumed moderately higher near-term mortality related to COVID-19, we have made no substantial change to our assumptions concerning morbidity, morbidity improvement, mortality, mortality improvement, terminations, or long-term care insurance premium rate increases in 2022. We regularly monitor emerging experience and industry developments, including these factors, to help us refine all our reserve assumptions, which may result in future changes to those assumptions."

          "text": "We have\ntwo\nreportable segments and\nthree\noperating segments. Operating segments are aggregated into a reportable segment if the operating segments have similar quantitative economic characteristics and if the operating segments are similar in the following qualitative characteristics: (i) nature of products and services; (ii) nature of production processes; (iii) type or class of customer for their products and services; (iv) methods used to distribute the products or provide services; and (v) if applicable, the nature of the regulatory environment. We have aggregated Defense & Systems and Propulsion & Additive Technology into\none\nreportable segment (Defense & Propulsion Technologies) based on similarity in economic characteristics, other qualitative factors and the objectives and principals of ASC 280, Segment Reporting. This is consistent with how our chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), allocates resources and makes decisions. Segment accounting policies are the same as described and referenced in Note 1. See About GE Aerospace for a description of our reporting segments as of December 31, 2024."

We incur contract fulfillment costs for engineering and development of products directly related to existing contracts with customers, primarily in our Defense & Propulsion Technologies segment. If we determine the costs are for development of products for a specific customer and there is a high probability of recovery from future sales to that customer, we capitalize the costs we incur, excluding early-stage costs which are expensed as research and development. Capitalized nonrecurring engineering costs are included in Contract and other deferred assets in our accompanying Statement of Financial Position and are amortized to Cost of equipment sold ratably over each unit sold. We periodically assess the recoverability of capitalized nonrecurring engineering costs and if we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the asset is impaired.\nSee Note 8 for further information."

          "text": "INSURANCE.\nOur run-off insurance operations include providing insurance and reinsurance for life and health risks and providing certain annuity products. Primary product types include long-term care, structured settlement annuities, life and disability insurance contracts and investment contracts. Insurance contracts are contracts with significant mortality and/or morbidity risks, while investment contracts are contracts without such risks. Insurance revenues are comprised primarily of premiums and investment income. For traditional long-duration insurance contracts, we report premiums as revenue when due. Premiums received on non-traditional long-duration insurance contracts and investment contracts, including annuities without significant mortality risk, are not reported as revenues but rather as deposit liabilities. We recognize revenues for charges and assessments on these contracts, mostly for mortality, administration and surrender. Interest credited to policyholder accounts is charged to expense."
