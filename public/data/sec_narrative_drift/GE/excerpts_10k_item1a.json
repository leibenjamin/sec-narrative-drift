Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future net premiums and were first established based on actuarial assumptions at the time the policies were issued or acquired plus a margin for adverse deviation. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, interest rates, health care experience (including type and cost of care), morbidity, mortality, the length of time a policy will remain in force and anticipated future premium increases from future in-force rate actions. Assumptions are locked-in throughout the life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops at which time we change these assumptions to reflect our most recent assumptions. Our annual premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of capitalized acquisition costs, using our most recent assumptions. Liabilities for investment contracts equal the account value, that is, the amount that accrues to the benefit of the contract or policyholder including credited interest and assessments through the financial statement date."

For the remainder of our equipment businesses, the new revenue standard\u2019s emphasis on transfer of control rather than risks and rewards has resulted in an accelerated timing of revenue recognition versus our previous accounting for certain products. While this change impacts all our businesses, our Renewable Energy business was most significantly impacted on a year over year basis with certain of their products recognized at an earlier point in time compared to historical standards. Our policy under ASC 605 was to defer recognition until all risk had transferred to the customer, which was generally upon product installation or customer acceptance. For these equipment contracts, the customer has control of the equipment in advance of the related installation or acceptance event based on our evaluation of the indicators provided in ASC 606. Consistent with our industry peers, certain of our businesses\u2019 products have transitioned either to a point in time or over time recognition based on the nature of the arrangement.

The planned business separations are expected to be effected through spin-offs by GE that are intended to be tax-free for the Company\u2019s shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These separation transactions will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including, among others, final approvals by GE\u2019s Board of Directors, receipt of tax rulings in certain jurisdictions and/or tax opinions from external counsel, the filing with the SEC and effectiveness of Form 10 registration statements, and satisfactory completion of financing. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the separation transactions for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring at all. Additionally, the separation transactions are complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes may affect our ability to complete one or both of the separation transactions as currently expected, within the anticipated timeframes or at all.

In May 2020, Boeing resumed production of the 737 MAX. In November 2020, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) lifted the grounding notice for the 737 MAX and Boeing commenced aircraft deliveries to customers in compliance with FAA regulatory requirements in December 2020. A number of other global regulators since the FAA's action have also lifted the orders that suspended 737 MAX operations for airlines under their jurisdictions. Aviation commercial equipment backlog as of December 31, 2020 includes approximately 9,600 LEAP engines, including the impact of approximately 1,500 LEAP-1B unit order cancellations in 2020. See the Segment Operations - Aviation section for further information. During 2020, CFM and Boeing reached an agreement to align production rates for 2020 and secure payment terms for engines delivered in 2019 and 2020. In 2020, Aviation received payments, net of progress collections, of $0.5 billion for engines delivered in 2019. A final payment of $0.2 billion, net of progress collections, is expected to be received in the first quarter of 2021 for engines delivered in 2019.

These procedures included updating certain experience studies since our last test completed in the third quarter of 2021, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. Using updated assumptions, the 2022 premium deficiency testing results indicated a positive margin of about 10 % of the related future policy benefit reserves recorded at September 30, 2022, or approximately equivalent to the 2021 premium deficiency testing results. The premium deficiency testing margin in 2022 was impacted by a lower discount rate in our ERAC portfolio due to the recapture transaction, as explained above, partially offset by higher prevailing benchmark interest rates in the U.S. The portfolio of investment securities expected to be received from the recapture transaction were assumed to be invested at yields below ERAC\u2019s current portfolio yield before ultimately grading to the long-term average investment yield as we reinvest the portfolio over time. This effect was partially offset by the net impact from assumed moderately higher near-term mortality related to COVID-19 in the aggregate across our run-off insurance products (i.e., for life insurance products, higher mortality increases the present value of expected future benefit payments, while for annuity and long-term care insurance contracts, higher mortality decreases the present value of expected future benefit payments). Excluding the net impact from assumed moderately higher near-term mortality related to COVID-19, we have made no substantial change to our assumptions concerning morbidity, morbidity improvement, mortality, mortality improvement, terminations, or long-term care insurance premium rate increases in 2022. We regularly monitor emerging experience and industry developments, including these factors, to help us refine all our reserve assumptions, which may result in future changes to those assumptions."

A comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. Premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes."

          "text": "2022 Premium Deficiency Testing . We completed our annual premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio in the third quarter of 2022. These procedures included updating certain experience studies since our last test completed in the third quarter of 2021, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. Using updated assumptions, the 2022 premium deficiency testing results indicated a positive margin of about 10% of the related future policy benefit reserves recorded at September 30, 2022, or approximately equivalent to the 2021 premium deficiency testing results."

          "text": "NONRECURRING ENGINEERING COSTS. We incur contract fulfillment costs for engineering and development of products directly related to existing or anticipated contracts with customers, primarily in our Defense & Propulsion Technologies segment. Contract fulfillment costs are capitalized to the extent recoverable from the customer contract, and subsequently amortized as the products are delivered to the customer. We periodically assess the recoverability of capitalized contract fulfillment costs, which requires significant judgement. Specifically, we estimate program volumes, contract revenue based on negotiated prices, and product costs based on input costs, inflation and productivity. See Note 8 for further information."

          "text": "Significant Trends & Developments . During the year ended December 31, 2023, the segment experienced higher orders and revenue from increased demand at Grid, Onshore Wind projects in the U.S. and higher revenue at Offshore Wind. Grid Solutions signed a significant agreement to supply its two-gigawatt HVDC systems to connect wind farms in the North Sea to the Netherlands and Germany. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) introduced new and extended existing tax incentives for at least 10 years. It has resolved recent U.S. policy uncertainty that resulted in project delays and deferral of customer investments in Onshore Wind and increased near- and longer-term demand in the U.S. for onshore and offshore wind projects. Included in our RPO of $42.8 billion at December 31, 2023 are service agreements on approximately 24,000 of our onshore wind turbines, from an installed base of over 55,000 units. New product introductions, such as our 3 MW, 5 MW and 6 MW Onshore units, and our 12-14 MW Haliade-X Offshore units, account for more than half of our RPO in Onshore and Offshore Wind. As of December 31, 2023, the first 13 MW Haliade-X units have achieved first power. Finally, our Grid business is positioned to support grid expansion and modernization needs."

          "text": "For the year ended December 31, 2023 , total revenues increased $9.9 billion (17%). Equipment revenues increased, primarily at Renewable Energy, due to higher equipment revenue at Offshore Wind associated with the Haliade-X ramp up, as well as at Grid; at Aerospace, due to an increase in commercial install and spare engine unit shipments; and at Power, due to increases at Gas Power and Power Conversion. Services revenues increased, primarily at Aerospace, due to increased commercial spare part shipments, internal shop visit volume and higher prices; and at Power, due to growth in Gas Power, Steam and Power Conversion; partially offset by a decrease at Renewable Energy, due to a decrease in repower revenue."

RPO as of December 31, 2022 increased $1.6 billion (5%) from December 31, 2021 primarily from new orders at Grid and Hydro exceeding sales, partially offset by the approximately $1.3 billion impact from a stronger U.S. dollar and revenue exceeding new orders at Offshore Wind."
