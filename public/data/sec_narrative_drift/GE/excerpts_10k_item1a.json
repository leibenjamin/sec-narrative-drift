Sale of Class A common stock resulted in an increase in noncontrolling interests of\n$4,214 million\n. Any reduction in our ownership interest below\n50%\nwill result in us losing control of BHGE. At that point, we would deconsolidate our Oil & Gas segment, recognize any remaining interest at fair value and recognize any difference between carrying value and fair value of our interest in earnings. Depending on the form and timing of our separation, and if BHGE\u2019s stock price remains below our current carrying value, we may recognize a significant loss in earnings. Based on BHGE's share price at January 31, 2019 of\n$23.57\nper share, the incremental loss upon deconsolidation by a sale of our interest would be approximately\n$8,400 million\n."

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.\nIn addition to the\ntwo\nVIEs detailed in Note 4, in our Statement of Financial Position, we have assets of $\n491\nmillion and $\n1,733\nmillion and liabilities of $\n206\nmillion and $\n657\nmillion, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, from other consolidated VIEs. The decline in assets and liabilities is primarily driven by the deconsolidation of our aeroderivative JV and the reduction of the deferred purchase price related to the discontinuation of our remaining unconsolidated receivables facility. These entities were created to help our customers facilitate or finance the purchase of GE equipment and services and have no features that could expose us to losses that would significantly exceed the difference between the consolidated assets and liabilities."

The remaining balance related to these discontinued programs was $\n161\nmillion as of December 31, 2021. As shown in the table below, WCS no longer holds any GE business receivables. Customer receivables held by WCS and third parties were $\n3,134\nmillion and $\n2,582\nmillion, respectively, at March 31, 2021. When GE businesses sell customer receivables to WCS or third parties, they accelerate the receipt of cash that would otherwise have been collected from customers. In any given period, the amount of cash received from sales of customer receivables compared to the cash GE would have otherwise collected had those customer receivables not been sold represents the cash generated or used in the period relating to this activity. As of December 31, 2020, GE businesses sold approximately\n40\n% of their gross customer receivables to WCS or third parties. Separately from the factoring programs that have been discontinued, the Company from time to time sells current or long-term receivables to third parties in response to customer-sponsored requests or programs, to facilitate sales, or for risk mitigation purposes.\nActivity related to customer receivables sold by GE businesses is as follows:"

The liability is measured for each group of contracts (i.e., cohorts) using current cash flow assumptions.

Future policy benefit reserves are adjusted each period as a result of updating lifetime net premium ratios for differences between actual and expected experience with the retroactive effect of those variances recognized in current period earnings. We review at least annually in the third quarter, future policy benefit reserves cash flow assumptions, except related claim expenses which remain locked-in, and if the review concludes that the assumptions need to be updated, future policy benefit reserves are adjusted retroactively based on the revised net premium ratio using actual historical experience, updated cash flow assumptions, and the locked-in discount rate with the effect of those changes recognized in current period earnings."

These procedures included updating certain experience studies since our last test completed in the third quarter of 2021, independent actuarial analysis (principally on long-term care insurance exposures) and review of industry benchmarks. Using updated assumptions, the 2022 premium deficiency testing results indicated a positive margin of about\n10\n% of the related future policy benefit reserves recorded at September 30, 2022, or approximately equivalent to the 2021 premium deficiency testing results. The premium deficiency testing margin in 2022 was impacted by a lower discount rate in our ERAC portfolio due to the recapture transaction, as explained above, partially offset by higher prevailing benchmark interest rates in the U.S. The portfolio of investment securities expected to be received from the recapture transaction were assumed to be invested at yields below ERAC\u2019s current portfolio yield before ultimately grading to the long-term average investment yield as we reinvest the portfolio over time. This effect was partially offset by the net impact from assumed moderately higher near-term mortality related to COVID-19 in the aggregate across our run-off insurance products (i.e., for life insurance products, higher mortality increases the present value of expected future benefit payments, while for annuity and long-term care insurance contracts, higher mortality decreases the present value of expected future benefit payments). Excluding the net impact from assumed moderately higher near-term mortality related to COVID-19, we have made no substantial change to our assumptions concerning morbidity, morbidity improvement, mortality, mortality improvement, terminations, or long-term care insurance premium rate increases in 2022. We regularly monitor emerging experience and industry developments, including these factors, to help us refine all our reserve assumptions, which may result in future changes to those assumptions."

As a result, we allocated goodwill among new and realigned reporting units using a relative fair value approach and performed assessments for the new reporting units. We assess the possibility that a reporting unit\u2019s fair value has been reduced below its carrying amount due to the occurrence of events or circumstances between annual impairment testing dates. In the third quarter of 2024, we performed an interim impairment test at our Colibrium Additive reporting unit within our Defense & Propulsion Technologies segment given declines in the additive manufacturing industry due to slower adoption of technology, which incorporated a combination of income and market valuation approaches. The results of the analysis indicated that the carrying value of the reporting unit was in excess of fair value and, therefore, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $\n251\nmillion in Goodwill impairments in our Statement of Earnings (Loss). After the impairment charges there is no remaining goodwill in the reporting unit. Colibrium Additive is a critical business for current and future technology at GE Aerospace as we continue to focus on where it can create the most value."
