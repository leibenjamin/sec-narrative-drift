This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses."

Significant deteriorations of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and our railroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures and depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected."

Such initiatives addressed for example, the regulation of banks and other major financial institutions, products and environmental and global-warming matters. These initiatives impact all of our businesses, albeit in varying ways. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negative impact on our operating businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have a significant, but not controlling economic interests. We cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows."

Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSF\u2019s business. Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates, without providing any recourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the business. For example, federal legislation, enacted in 2008 and amended in 2015, mandated the implementation of positive train control technology by December 31, 2020, on certain mainline track where inter-city and commuter passenger railroads operate and where toxic-by-inhalation (\u201cTIH\u201d) hazardous materials are transported. Complying with legislative and regulatory changes may pose significant operating and implementation risks and require significant capital expenditures."

To the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of fuel in generating electricity or alternate fuels, such as natural gas, displace coal on a competitive basis, revenues and earnings could be adversely affected. As a common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport TIH chemicals and other hazardous materials. A release of hazardous materials could expose BNSF to significant claims, losses, penalties and environmental remediation obligations. Changes in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSF\u2019s ability to determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity."

Most of the contracts remaining at year end 2020 will expire by February 2023. Risks of losses under these contracts are based on declines in equity prices of stocks comprising certain major U.S. and international stock indexes. We received considerable cash premiums as compensation for accepting these risks. Absent major reductions in future equity securities prices, our ultimate payment obligations are not likely to be significant. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that equity securities prices will not decline significantly resulting in significant settlement payments upon contract expirations."

Buffett, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, age 90, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, age 97. If for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be a material adverse effect on our operations. However, Berkshire\u2019s Board of Directors has identified certain current Berkshire managers who, in their judgment, are capable of succeeding Mr. Buffett and has agreed on a replacement for Mr. Buffett should a replacement be needed currently. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter its current view regarding a replacement for Mr. Buffett in the future. We believe that the Board\u2019s succession plan, together with the outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk. In 2018, Berkshire\u2019s Board of Directors appointed Mr. Gregory Abel as Vice Chairman of Berkshire\u2019s non-insurance operations and Mr. Ajit Jain as Vice Chairman of Berkshire\u2019s insurance operations. Mr. Abel and Mr. Jain each report directly to Mr. Buffett and Mr. Buffett continues to be responsible for major capital allocation and investment decisions."

          "text": "When properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a single event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a single catastrophe event resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attacks. We employ various disciplined underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possible correlations and avoid writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single catastrophe event might aggregate above $10 billion. Currently, we estimate that our aggregate exposure from a single event under outstanding policies is significantly below $10 billion. However, despite our efforts, it is possible that losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Additionally, various provisions of our policies, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage, negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. Our tolerance for significant insurance losses may result in lower reported earnings in a future period."
