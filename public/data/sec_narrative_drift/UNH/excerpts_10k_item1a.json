In addition, certain of our pharmacy services operations are subject to the clinical quality, patient safety and other risks inherent in the dispensing, packaging and distribution of drugs, including claims related to purported dispensing and other operational errors. We may also be party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers.

The future impact to our business is primarily dependent upon the ultimate pacing, intensity and duration of the crisis, the severity of new variants of the COVID-19 virus, and the effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccinations and treatments, factors which remain uncertain at this time. These factors continue to affect the related treatment, testing, coverage and other services we provide for the people we serve. We may experience an increase in medical care costs as people seek care which was deferred during the pandemic and individuals with chronic conditions may require additional care needs resulting from missed treatments. The premiums and fees we charge, including premiums dependent upon documented health conditions, may not be sufficient to cover the medical and administrative costs associated with COVID-19 and other care services. Similarly, state and federal mandates for coverage may result in additional incurred expenses that are not associated with increases in government reimbursement (such as requirements for insurers to cover at-home COVID-19 testing).We have experienced and may continue to experience reduced demand for certain services Optum provides to care providers, health plans and employers as a result of reduced clinical and claims activity and changes in business priorities resulting from COVID-19. In addition, our care delivery business may continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 infections and exposures affecting providers we employ, resulting in reduced capacity to handle demand for care and related partial or full closures of our facilities. Our non-clinical workforce may also be adversely impacted by COVID-19 infections and exposures impacting our business operations."

Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback, beneficiary inducement and other laws governing the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies, customers and consumers. In addition, federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry which could materially affect current industry practices, including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals, limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies. Additionally, various governmental agencies have conducted investigations into certain PBM practices, which have resulted in other PBMs agreeing to civil penalties, including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements. As a provider of pharmacy benefit management services, OptumRx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure, registration and other laws and accreditation standards impacting the business practices of a pharmacy benefit manager. OptumRx also conducts business through home delivery, specialty and compounding pharmacies, pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion, which subjects it to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those of the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Boards of Pharmacy."

Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies and Medicaid contracts is typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual or family served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences. Our revenue on certain Medicare policies is based on bids submitted to CMS in June of the year before the contract year. Our premium revenue on fully accountable value-based care products at Optum Health is typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served. Although we base the commercial, Medicaid and value-based premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, costs to deliver care, large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics.

If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners, including by developing additional products and services, providing high levels of service, pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes, our alliances and joint ventures could be damaged or terminated, which in turn could adversely impact our reputation, business and results of operations. Further, governmental actions, such as actions by the FTC or DOJ, may affect our ability to complete our merger and acquisition transactions, which could adversely affect our future growth. If we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions to meet our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows."

          "text": "As we operate our business outside of the United States, we face risks different from those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses, including risks in adapting to new markets, languages, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments. Managing these risks could require us to devote significant senior management attention and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from those businesses. These risks vary widely by country and, outside of the United States, may include political instability, government intervention, unanticipated court decisions, discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions, which could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate, or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies."
