Our overall effective income tax rate is a function of applicable local tax rates and the geographic mix of our income before taxes, which is itself impacted by currency movements. Consequently, the isolated or combined effects of unfavorable movements in tax rates, geographic mix, or foreign exchange rates could reduce our after-tax income. We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries. If our capital or financing needs in the United States require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels, our effective tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted."

Such events could impair our ability to manage our business around the world, could disrupt our supply of raw materials and ingredients, and could impact production, transportation and delivery of concentrates, syrups and finished products. In addition, such events could cause disruption of regional or global economic activity, which can affect consumers' purchasing power in the affected areas and, therefore, reduce demand for our products."

The prices for these ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. Substantial increases in the prices of our or our bottling partners' ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials, to the extent they cannot be recouped through increases in the prices of finished beverage products, would increase our and our bottling partners' operating costs and could reduce our profitability. Increases in the prices of our finished products resulting from a higher cost of ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials could affect affordability in some markets and reduce Coca-Cola system sales. In addition, some of our ingredients, such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, saccharin and ascorbic acid, as well as some packaging containers, such as aluminum cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers, and certain other ingredients are available from only one source each. Furthermore, some of our suppliers are located in countries experiencing political or other risks. We cannot assure you that we and our bottling partners will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers or that our contingency plans will be effective in preventing disruptions that may arise from shortages of any ingredient that is available from a limited number of suppliers or from only one source ."

The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. Proposition 65 exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in California because it does not provide for any generally applicable quantitative threshold below which the presence of a listed substance is exempt from the warning requirement. Consequently, the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. However, Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of the product in question exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is below a \"safe harbor\" threshold that may be established, is naturally occurring, is the result of necessary cooking or is subject to another applicable exception. One or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 lists, or that may be added to the lists in the future, can be detected in certain Company products at low levels that are safe. With respect to substances that have not yet been listed under Proposition 65, the Company takes the position that listing is not scientifically justified. With respect to substances that are already listed, the Company takes the position that the presence of each such substance in Company products is subject to an applicable exemption from the warning requirement or that the product is otherwise in compliance with Proposition 65. The state of California and other parties, however, have in the past taken a contrary position and may do so in the future. If we were required to add Proposition 65 warnings on the labels of one or more of our beverage products produced for sale in California, the resulting consumer reaction to the warnings and possible adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and in other markets."

In addition, in December 2016, we announced that we reached an agreement regarding the transition of Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s (\"ABI\") controlling interest in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited (\"CCBA\") and our intention to hold CCBA\u2019s territories temporarily until they can be refranchised to other partners. For more information regarding this transaction, refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, \"Item 8.

Our refranchising activities require significant attention and effort on the part of, and therefore may become a distraction for, senior management. In addition, in connection with refranchising transactions in North America, we recorded, and we expect will continue to record, losses primarily related to the derecognition of intangible assets transferred or that will be transferred to bottling partners. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete refranchising transactions on our expected timetable and on terms and conditions favorable to us; that our refranchising bottling or joint venture partners will be efficient and aligned with our long-term vision for the Coca-Cola system; or that we will be able to maintain good relationships with the refranchised bottling operations. If we are unable to complete contemplated refranchising transactions timely, on favorable terms and with partners who share our long-term vision for the Coca-Cola system, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected."

In particular, sales of our products in the away-from-home channels have been significantly negatively affected by shelter-in-place regulations or recommendations, closings of restaurants and cancellations of major sporting and other events that were imposed as a result of the initial COVID-19 outbreak. While some of these restrictions have been lifted or eased in many jurisdictions as the rates of COVID-19 infections have decreased or stabilized, resurgence of the pandemic in some markets has slowed the reopening process.

These conflicts have resulted, and could continue to result, in volatile commodity markets; logistical, transportation and supply chain disruptions; increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems; reputational risk; heightened risks to employee safety; business disruptions (including labor shortages); reduced availability and increased costs of transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other input costs; sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulation; or difficulty protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights. While we currently do not anticipate that the effects of these conflicts will have a material impact on our results of operations, we cannot predict how and the extent to which these conflicts will continue to affect our employees, operations, customers or business partners."

The OECD is currently coordinating a two pillared project on behalf of the G20 and other participating countries which would grant additional taxing rights over profits earned by multinational enterprises to the countries in which their products are sold and services rendered. Pillar One would allow countries to reallocate a portion of profits earned by multinational businesses with an annual global revenue exceeding \u20ac20 billion and a profit margin of over 10% to applicable market jurisdictions. While the OECD issued draft language for the international implementation of Pillar One in October 2023, both the substantive rules and implementation process remain under discussion at the OECD so the timetable for any implementation remains uncertain."

The directive requires the rules to initially become effective for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, 2023. While it is uncertain whether the United States will enact legislation to adopt Pillar Two, numerous countries have enacted legislation, or have indicated their intent to adopt legislation, to implement certain aspects of Pillar Two effective January 1, 2024, with general implementation of the remaining global minimum tax rules by January 1, 2025. The OECD and implementing countries are expected to continue to make further revisions to their legislation and release additional guidance."

The extent and nature of governmental actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have varied across our markets based upon the then-current extent and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. At times we have experienced a decrease in sales of certain of our products in markets around the world, as well as a shift in consumer demand to more at-home consumption versus away-from-home consumption. While we have experienced improved trends throughout 2021 and 2022 in away-from-home channels and improved margins, our recovery has been asynchronous, and the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain. If COVID-19 infection rates increase, the pandemic intensifies, or continued efforts to curb the pandemic are ineffective, the negative impacts of the pandemic on our sales could be more prolonged and may become more severe than what we have experienced to date."

Additionally, from time to time, we have acquired or taken control of bottling operations, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. We may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with acquiring businesses, brands or bottling operations. The expected benefits of business or brand acquisitions, including cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions, may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to successfully integrating the operations, technologies, services, products and systems of any acquired businesses in an effective, timely and cost-efficient manner. We may also encounter unexpected difficulties, costs or delays in restructuring and integrating acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations into our Company\u2019s operating, governance, sustainability and internal control structures, including extending our Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired businesses, which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in their financial records and in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, our quality management program, which is designed to ensure product quality and safety, may not be sufficiently robust to effectively manage the expanded range of product offerings introduced through newly acquired businesses or brands, which may increase our costs or subject us to negative publicity. Also, we may not be able to successfully manage the additional complexities involved with overseeing various supply chain models as we expand our product offerings. Our financial performance is impacted by how well we can integrate and manage acquired businesses, brands and bottling operations, and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations. If we incur unforeseen liabilities or costs in connection with acquiring or integrating businesses, brands or bottling operations, experience internal control or product quality failures, or are unable to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, our consolidated results could be negatively affected."

On December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference rates. Other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities, ceased to be published in July 2023. As a result of the discontinuation of LIBOR, we have amended our LIBOR-referencing agreements to either reference the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate, but it is possible that these changes may have an adverse impact on our financing costs as compared to LIBOR in the long term. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. In assessing our credit strength, credit rating agencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, some credit rating agencies also consider financial information of certain of our major bottling partners.
