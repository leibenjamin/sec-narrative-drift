These risks include but are not limited to changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s economic or political conditions, local labor conditions and regulations, safety and environmental regulations, reduced protection of intellectual property rights, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, restrictions on currency exchange activities, currency exchange fluctuations, burdensome taxes and tariffs, enforceability of legal agreements and judgments, adverse tax, administrative agency or judicial outcomes, and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases. International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, could limit the Company\u2019s ability to transact business in these markets and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results. There has been a recent increase in populism and nationalism in various countries around the world and the concept and benefits of free trade are being challenged. The Company has benefited from the free flow of agricultural and food and feed ingredient products from the U.S. and other sources to markets around the world. Should there be an increase in tariff and restrictive trade activities around the world, the Company could be negatively impacted from its inability to enter certain markets or the price of the products being less competitive in the destination markets."

These interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, risk management activities, converting raw materials to finished products, inventory management, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, human resources benefits and payroll management, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage the business. The Company is also in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis as part of its ongoing business transformation program, which is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes and the underlying systems environment. Increased IT security threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of the Company\u2019s IT systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the Company\u2019s third party data. The Company has put in place security measures to prevent, detect, and mitigate cyber-based attacks and instituted control procedures for cyber security incident responses and disaster recovery plans for its critical systems. In addition, the Company monitors this risk on an ongoing basis to detect and correct any breaches and reports metrics to the highest level of management and to the Board of Directors on the quality of the Company\u2019s data security efforts and control environment. However, if the Company\u2019s IT systems are breached, damaged, or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and the Company\u2019s disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate the risks on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage its operations, loss of valuable data, and damage to its reputation, which may adversely impact the Company\u2019s revenues, operating results, and financial condition."

The Company\u2019s working capital requirements, including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges, are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly. The Company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities, processing plants, refineries, mills, ports, transportation assets and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments, technological advances, regulations and changing safety standards in the industry. Moreover, the expansion of the Company\u2019s business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. Access to credit markets and pricing of the Company\u2019s capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies. Sufficient credit ratings allow the Company to access tier one commercial paper markets. If the Company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings, access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, it could restrict the Company\u2019s current operations and its growth opportunities which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results."

          "text": "The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to changes in weather conditions, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Additionally, the Company depends globally on agricultural producers to ensure an adequate supply of the agricultural commodities used by the Company in its operations is maintained. These factors have historically caused volatility in the availability and prices of agricultural commodities and, consequently, in the Company\u2019s operating results and working capital requirements. Reduced supply of agricultural commodities due to weather-related factors or other reasons could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials and/or limiting the Company\u2019s ability to procure, transport, store, process, and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner. For example, a drought in North America in 2012 reduced the availability of corn and soybean inventories while prices increased. High and volatile commodity prices can adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to meet its liquidity needs. Conversely, if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cyles, price volatility is somewhat diminished. This could result in reduced operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities."

The Company is required to comply with the numerous and broad-reaching laws and regulations administered by United States federal, state and local, and foreign governmental authorities. The Company must comply with other general business regulations such as accounting and income taxes, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, global trade, trade sanctions, environmental, and handling and production of regulated substances. The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company. As examples, the Company has received large tax assessments from tax authorities in Brazil and Argentina, challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the Company covering various prior periods. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the Company to administrative, civil, and criminal remedies including fines, penalties, disgorgement, injunctions, and recalls of its products, and damage to its reputation."

One of the Company\u2019s strategies is to expand the global reach of its core model which may include expanding or developing its business in emerging market areas such as Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of economic downturns, including decreased demand for the Company\u2019s products, and reduced availability of credit, or declining credit quality of the Company\u2019s suppliers, customers, and other counterparties.

The company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as agricultural commodities, transportation services, and other materials and supplies, as well as for workforce and talent. Additionally, competitors offer similar products and services, as well as alternative products and services, to the Company\u2019s customers. The Company is dependent on being able to generate revenues in excess of cost of products sold in order to obtain margins, profits, and cash flows to meet or exceed its targeted financial performance measures and provide cash for operating, working capital, dividend, or capital expenditure needs. Competition impacts the Company\u2019s ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors. Pricing of the Company\u2019s products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity, which is impacted by competitor actions to bring idled capacity on-line, build new production capacity or execute aggressive consolidation. Many of the products bought and sold by the Company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities. The markets for global commodities are highly price competitive and in many cases the commodities are subject to substitution. Significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries, could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than U.S. products, thereby negatively impacting the competitiveness of the Company\u2019s significant origination, processing, and export footprint, and the Company\u2019s operating results. Improved yields in different crop growing regions may reduce the reliance on origination territories in which the Company has a significant presence. In addition, continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry that could impact the relative competitiveness of the Company, especially when acquirers are state-owned and/or backed by public funds and have profit and return objectives that may differ from publicly traded enterprises. To compete effectively, the Company focuses on improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations, developing and maintaining appropriate market share, maintaining a high level of product safety and quality, and working with customers to develop new products and tailored solutions."

For example, a drought in Argentina in 2017 and 2018 reduced the availability of corn and soybean inventories while prices increased. High and volatile commodity prices can place more pressures on short-term working capital funding. Conversely, if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cycles, price volatility is somewhat diminished. This could result in reduced operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities."

The Company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as raw materials, transportation services, and other materials and supplies, as well as for workforce and talent. Competition impacts the Company\u2019s ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors: Pricing of the Company\u2019s products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity, which is impacted by competitor actions to bring idled capacity on-line, build new production capacity or execute aggressive consolidation; many of the products bought and sold by the Company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities that are highly price competitive and, in many cases, subject to substitution; significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries, could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than U.S. products; improved yields in different crop growing regions may reduce the reliance on origination territories in which the Company has a significant presence; and continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations could result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry, especially when acquirers are state-owned and/or backed by public funds and have profit and return objectives that may differ from publicly traded enterprises. To compete effectively, the Company focuses on safely improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations, developing and maintaining appropriate market presence, maintaining a high level of product safety and quality, supporting socially responsible and sustainable practices, promoting environmental responsibility, and working with customers to develop new products and tailored solutions."

Corn germ, a by-product of the wet milling process, is further processed into vegetable oil and protein meal. Other Carbohydrate Solutions products include citric acids, which are used in various food and industrial products. The Carbohydrate Solutions segment is a leader in carbon capture and sequestration. By continuing to advance additional carbon capture and sequestration initiatives and products aimed at replacing coal power and steam generation with lower emissions power, the Carbohydrate Solutions segment is well positioned to benefit from the replacement of essential materials historically made from fossil fuels with plant-based alternatives."

The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. Compliance with and interpretation of various data privacy regulations continue to evolve and any violation could subject the Company to legal claims, regulatory penalties, and damage to its reputation. The Company has put in place security measures to prevent, detect, and mitigate cyber-based attacks, and has instituted control procedures for cybersecurity incident responses and disaster recovery plans for its critical systems. In addition, the Company monitors this risk on an ongoing basis to detect and correct any breaches, and reports metrics on the quality of the Company\u2019s data security efforts and control environment to the highest level of management and to the Board of Directors. However, if the Company\u2019s IT systems are breached, damaged, or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and the Company\u2019s disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate the risks on a timely basis, the Company may suffer significant interruptions in its ability to manage its operations, loss of valuable data, actual or threatened legal actions, and damage to its reputation, which may adversely impact the Company\u2019s revenues, operating results, and financial condition."
