COVID-19 or other health epidemics, pandemics, or similar outbreaks could impact the Company\u2019s operations if significant portions of its workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, lockdowns, government actions, facility closures, or other restrictions. Additionally, third party service providers, suppliers, joint ventures, customers, and other business partners may not be able fulfill their commitments creating additional disruptions for the Company. In such circumstances, ADM may be unable to perform fully on its contractual obligations, critical global supply chain and logistical networks may be affected, and costs and working capital may increase. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance. In addition, demand for certain products that ADM produces, particularly biofuels and ingredients that go into food and beverages that support the food services channels, may be materially impacted from a prolonged outbreak of COVID-19 or significant local resurgences of the virus, leading to additional government-imposed lockdowns, quarantines, or other restrictions. The Company cannot at this time predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its future financial or operational results, but the impact could potentially be material over time."

The Company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as raw materials, transportation services, and other materials and supplies, as well as for workforce and talent. Competition impacts the Company\u2019s ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors: Pricing of the Company\u2019s products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity, which is impacted by competitor actions to bring idled capacity on-line, build new production capacity or execute aggressive consolidation; many of the products bought and sold by the Company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities that are highly price competitive and, in many cases, subject to substitution; significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries, could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than U.S. products; improved yields in different crop growing regions may reduce the reliance on origination territories in which the Company has a significant presence; and continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations could result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry, especially when acquirers are state-owned and/or backed by public funds and have profit and return objectives that may differ from publicly traded enterprises. To compete effectively, the Company focuses on safely improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations, developing and maintaining appropriate market presence, maintaining a high level of product safety and quality, supporting socially responsible and sustainable practices, promoting environmental responsibility, and working with customers to develop new products and tailored solutions."

The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the Company to administrative, civil, and criminal remedies, including fines, penalties, disgorgement, injunctions, and recalls of its products, and damage to its reputation. Resolution of some of these tax disputes could take many years and interest and penalties may be accruing in the meantime, thereby significantly increasing the notional amount of the exposures."

Recent investments outside the U.S. include Neovia, certain assets of Brazil-based Algar Agro, Protexin, Ziegler, Rodelle, Inc., and Yerbalatina. Growth in new geographies outside the U.S. can expose the Company to volatile economic, political, and regulatory risks that may negatively impact its operations and ability to achieve its growth strategy. Expanding businesses where the Company has limited presence may expose the Company to risks related to the inability to identify an appropriate partner or target and favorable terms, inability to retain/hire strategic talent, or integration risks that may require significant management resources that would have otherwise been available for ongoing growth or operational initiatives. Acquisitions may involve unanticipated delays, costs, and other problems. Due diligence performed prior to the acquisition may not identify a material liability or issue that could impact the Company's reputation or adversely affect results of operations resulting in a reduction of the anticipated acquisition benefits. Additionally, acquisitions may involve integration risks such as: internal control effectiveness, system integration risks, the risk of impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangibles, ability to retain acquired employees, and other unanticipated risks."

The assets and operations located in the region affected by the conflict in Ukraine are at an increased risk to property damage, inventory loss, business disruption, and expropriation. The conflict could continue to impact global margins due to increased commodity, energy, and input costs. The Black Sea region is a major exporter of wheat and corn to the world, and the disruption of supply could cause volatility in prices and margins of these commodities and related products. In addition to ADM\u2019s operations, one of the Company\u2019s joint ventures is also exposed to the same risks. While the Company has a robust trade sanctions compliance program, there is a risk that ADM and its related parties could trade with a sanctioned partner due to the number of sanctions taken against Russia. The Company may also face increased cyber risk given that Russia is known to have extensive capabilities to engage in cyber attacks. Trade receivables may be at risk of higher defaults, and other third-party risks could affect ADM\u2019s ability to obtain inputs if suppliers are unable to perform or face insolvency, as certain supplies may not be attainable due to sanctions and/or restrictions on cross-border payment transactions. The Company could be materially impacted if, in the worst-case scenario, the conflict advances to other countries. In such circumstances, trade policies and the Company\u2019s critical global supply chain and logistical networks could be affected, impairing the Company\u2019s ability to satisfy contractual obligations and impacting working capital requirements. Insurance may not adequately cover these risks. In addition, provisions for certain products that ADM produces, particularly those that support the food services channels, could be materially impacted. The Company continues to monitor the conflict in Ukraine along with other political tensions and evaluate alternatives to mitigate the impacts of these risks."

In addition, the Company monitors this risk on an ongoing basis to detect and correct any breaches, and reports metrics on the quality of the Company\u2019s data security efforts and control environment to the highest level of management and to the Board of Directors. However, if the Company\u2019s IT systems are breached, damaged, or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and the Company\u2019s disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate the risks on a timely basis, the Company may suffer significant interruptions in its ability to manage its operations, loss of valuable data, actual or threatened legal actions, and damage to its reputation, which may adversely impact the Company\u2019s revenues, operating results, and financial condition."

Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of any ERP may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to operate its business, or maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting. These implementations, modifications and upgrades may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. In addition, difficulties with implementing new technology systems, such as ERPs, delays in the Company\u2019s timeline for planned improvements, significant system failures or the Company\u2019s inability to successfully modify its IT systems, policies, procedures or monitoring tools to respond to changes in its business needs in the past have caused and in the future may cause disruptions in the Company\u2019s business operations, increase security risks, including the risk of cybersecurity breaches, and may have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations."
