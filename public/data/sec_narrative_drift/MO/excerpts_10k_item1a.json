In April 2019, Altria and JUUL received a request for additional information (commonly referred to as a \u201csecond request\u201d) from the FTC as part of the antitrust review process. A second request extends the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d), while the FTC conducts its review, until 30 days after the parties have substantially complied with the second request or as otherwise agreed to by the parties. As of October 30, 2019, Altria and JUUL certified substantial compliance with the second request. Based on the timing agreement among Altria, JUUL and the FTC staff and related extensions for the convenience of the parties, Altria believes the FTC will complete its review in the first half of 2020. While conducting its review, on October 1, 2019, the FTC issued a Civil Investigative Demand to Altria seeking information regarding, among other things, Altria\u2019s role in the resignation of JUUL\u2019s former chief executive officer and the hiring by JUUL of any current or former Altria director, executive or employee."

As a result, we determined that our investment in JUUL was impaired and recorded a total pre-tax impairment charge of $8.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, reported as impairment of JUUL equity securities in our consolidated statements of earnings. Of this amount, Altria recorded pre-tax charges of $4.5 billion in the third quarter of 2019 and $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. The third quarter impairment charge was due primarily to lower e-vapor sales volume assumptions in the U.S. and international markets and a delay in achieving operating margin performance, as compared to the assumptions at the time of the JUUL transaction. The fourth quarter impairment charge resulted substantially from increased discount rates applied to future cash flow projections, due to the increase in the number and type of legal cases pending against JUUL during the fourth quarter of 2019. While we believe the December 31, 2019 valuation of $4.2 billion is the appropriate current fair value of our investment, the risks identified in this paragraph, some of which are also further discussed in Note 19 and in Item 7.\nTobacco Space - Business Environment\n, are ongoing with respect to the current fair value. If the fair value of our investment in JUUL continues to decrease, it could have a material adverse effect on Altria\u2019s consolidated financial position or earnings."

For example, in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a temporary suspension of operations at PM USA\u2019s Richmond, Virginia manufacturing facility, which is the primary facility for manufacturing PM USA cigarettes.

Operations of our subsidiaries, suppliers, distributors and distribution chain service providers and those of our investees could be suspended temporarily once or multiple times, or closed permanently, depending on various factors, including how long the COVID-19 pandemic persists and the extent to which state, local and federal governments, as well as foreign countries, impose restrictions on the operation of facilities or otherwise place limits on the supply and distribution chains. An extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more of Altria\u2019s subsidiaries, investees or in the supply or distribution of goods or services by one or more key suppliers, distributors or distribution chain service providers could have a material adverse effect on the business, the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Altria and its tobacco and wine subsidiaries and investees."

As a result, we determined that our investment in JUUL was impaired and recorded a total pre-tax impairment charge of $8.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, reported as impairment of JUUL equity securities in our consolidated statements of earnings. Of this amount, Altria recorded pre-tax charges of $4.5 billion in the third quarter of 2019 and $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. The third quarter impairment charge was due primarily to lower e-vapor sales volume assumptions in the U.S. and international markets and a delay in achieving operating margin performance, as compared to the assumptions at the time of the JUUL transaction. The fourth quarter impairment charge resulted substantially from increased discount rates applied to future cash flow projections, due to the increase in the number and type of legal cases pending against JUUL during the fourth quarter of 2019. While we believe the December 31, 2019 valuation of $4.2 billion is the appropriate current fair value of our investment, the risks identified in this paragraph, some of which are also further discussed in Note 19 and in Item 7.\nTobacco Space - Business Environment\n, are ongoing with respect to the current fair value.

In April 2019, Altria and JUUL received a request for additional information (commonly referred to as a \u201csecond request\u201d) from the FTC as part of the antitrust review process. A second request extends the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d), while the FTC conducts its review, until 30 days after the parties have substantially complied with the second request or as otherwise agreed to by the parties. As of October 30, 2019, Altria and JUUL certified substantial compliance with the second request.

For example, we have plans to increase the distribution of NJOY products, enhance\nNJOY ACE\n\u2019s brand equity, increase the brand\u2019s awareness and appeal and receive FDA authorizations on certain NJOY products. If we are not successful in executing these strategies, there could be a material negative impact on our business and our ability to achieve our Vision."

In April 2020, the FTC issued an administrative complaint against Altria and JUUL alleging that our 35% investment in JUUL and the associated agreements constitute an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and Section 5 of the FTC Act, and substantially lessened competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act. The FTC seeks a broad range of remedies, including divestiture of our minority investment in JUUL, rescission of the transaction and all associated agreements, a requirement of FTC approval of future agreements related to the development, manufacture, distribution or sale of e-vapor"

For example, in the Federal Government\u2019s lawsuit, the district court did not impose monetary penalties but ordered significant non-monetary remedies, including the issuance of \u201ccorrective statements.\u201d In the patent lawsuit adjudicated before the ITC, the ITC banned the importation of\nIQOS\ndevices,\nMarlboro HeatSticks\nand component parts into the United States and the sale and marketing of any such products previously imported into the United States. As a result of the ITC\u2019s decision, PM USA removed the\nIQOS\ndevices,\nMarlboro HeatSticks\nand any infringing components from the marketplace. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) has issued an administrative complaint against Altria and JUUL on antitrust grounds that, if successful, would allow the FTC to order a broad range of non-monetary remedies with respect to our investment in JUUL, including divestiture of our minority investment in JUUL, rescission of the transaction and all associated agreements, a requirement of FTC approval of future agreements related to the development, manufacture, distribution or sale of e-vapor products and prohibition against any officer or director of either Altria or JUUL serving on the other party\u2019s board of directors or attending meetings of the other party\u2019s board of directors and notice to the FTC in advance of certain corporate actions, including acquisitions, mergers or certain corporate restructurings."

The expected savings associated with the Initiative may be offset to some extent by business disruption during the implementation phase as well as investments in new processes and systems until such time as the Initiative is fully implemented. The accelerated frequency and scale of new technology and systems deployment to support the Initiative may increase risks to our internal control framework, protection of sensitive data and regulatory compliance. Additionally, the Initiative may lead to a loss of control and oversight of outsourced functions, which could weaken our existing internal control over financial reporting and present audit challenges. If the vendors to whom we outsource certain tasks do not adhere to our financial controls and compliance processes and procedures, we could be at an increased risk for fraud and financial misstatements."

          "text": "In the e-vapor category, illicit flavored disposable product usage has significantly increased, and such products now comprise the majority of the e-vapor category. The impacts of this dynamic include declines in pod-based e-vapor product volume and increased cross-category movement among adult cigarette smokers that has contributed to higher than expected domestic cigarette industry volume declines. Recent enforcement actions by regulatory agencies have not had a material impact in curbing the proliferation and sale of illicit disposable e-vapor products. This dynamic has made the operating environment challenging for our businesses. We have increased engagement with the FDA and other government agencies to encourage enforcement action against these illicit products, but such enforcement has been inadequate to date. We also have taken legal action to protect our lawful e-vapor business, which exposes us to additional costs and expenses. Our failure to counter the impacts of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products and the FDA\u2019s failure to take meaningful enforcement actions against manufacturers and products that violate the law could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision."

Additionally, in January 2025, in a patent lawsuit adjudicated before the ITC, the ITC imposed bans on the importation of\nNJOY ACE\ninto the United States and the sale and marketing of\nNJOY ACE\nproducts previously imported into the United States. If the bans on the importation into the United States and the sale and marketing of\nNJOY ACE\nbecome effective or continued illicit e-vapor product sales or other factors result in a significantly unfavorable long-term outlook for NJOY\u2019s volume growth rates versus our projections used to estimate the fair value, either development could result in a non-cash impairment of our e-vapor reporting unit\u2019s goodwill or related definite-lived intangible assets, or both, in future periods."
