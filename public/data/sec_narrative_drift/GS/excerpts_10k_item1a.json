In that case, Group Inc.'s security holders would face losses while the third-party creditors of Group Inc.'s subsidiaries would incur no losses because the subsidiaries would continue to operate and would not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, holders of Group Inc.'s eligible long-term debt and holders of Group Inc.'s other debt securities could face losses ahead of its other similarly situated creditors in a resolution under OLA if the FDIC exercised its right, described above, to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims."

In addition, if our financial resources deteriorate so severely that resolution may be imminent, (i) the committed line of credit will automatically terminate and the unsecured subordinated funding note will automatically be forgiven, (ii) all intercompany receivables owed by the major subsidiaries to Group Inc. will be transferred to Funding IHC or their maturities will be extended to five years, (iii) Group Inc. will be obligated to transfer substantially all of its remaining intercompany receivables and GCLA (other than an amount to fund anticipated bankruptcy expenses) to Funding IHC, and (iv) Funding IHC will be obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to the major subsidiaries. Group Inc.'s and Funding IHC's obligations under the CLSA are secured pursuant to a related security agreement. Such actions would materially and adversely affect Group Inc.'s liquidity. As a result, during a period of severe stress, Group Inc. might commence bankruptcy proceedings at an earlier time than it otherwise would if the CLSA and related security agreement had not been implemented."

These evolving laws and regulations could require changes in our implementation of AI technology and increase our compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that result in the release of private, confidential or proprietary information, that reflect biases included in the data on which they are trained, infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, or that is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it challenging to understand why they are generating particular outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring the capabilities of the AI models, reducing erroneous output, eliminating bias and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, we may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train their models, including risks arising from the inclusion of any unauthorized material in the training data for their models, and the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated with the output of their models, matters over which we may have limited visibility.

The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (LIBOR Act), that was enacted in March 2022, provides a statutory framework to replace USD LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for contracts governed by U.S. law that have no fallbacks or fallbacks that would require the use of a poll or LIBOR-based rate. In December 2022, the FRB adopted a final rule that implements the LIBOR Act, which will become effective on February 27, 2023. The final rule identifies different SOFR-based replacement rates for derivative contracts, for cash instruments such as floating-rate notes and preferred stock, for consumer contracts, for certain government-sponsored enterprise contracts and for certain student loan securitizations that lack a fallback to an alternative rate when USD LIBOR ceases to be published on June 30, 2023.

As a result, and despite the enactment of the LIBOR Act, for the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings, the selection of a successor rate could result in client disputes and litigation surrounding the proper interpretation of our IBOR-based contracts and financial instruments.

          "text": "There has been a trend towards increased regulation and supervision of our branches and subsidiaries by the governments and regulators in the countries in which those branches and subsidiaries are located or do business. Concerns about protecting clients and creditors of branches and subsidiaries of financial institutions that are located outside of the country in which such branches or subsidiaries are located or do business have caused or may cause a number of governments and regulators to take additional steps to \u201cring fence\u201d or require internal total loss-absorbing capacity (which may also be subject to \u201cbail-in\u201d powers, as described below) at those branches and subsidiaries in order to protect clients and creditors of those branches and subsidiaries in the event of financial difficulties involving those branches and subsidiaries. The result has been and may continue to be additional limitations on our ability to efficiently move capital and liquidity among our affiliated entities, or to Group Inc., including in times of stress, thereby increasing the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us on a consolidated basis."

The outcomes of the elections are expected to result in changes in policy, which could also have adverse effects on us or the business environment in which we operate more generally. For example, the new U.S. presidential administration has imposed or increased tariffs, including on imports from China, and proposed imposing or increasing tariffs on U.S. trading partners, which could adversely affect markets, the business environment and some of our businesses."

As a result, we face additional compliance, legal and regulatory risk, including with respect to know-your-customer, anti-money laundering and reporting requirements and prohibitions on transfers of property belonging to countries, entities and individuals subject to sanctions by U.S. or other governmental authorities. We are making significant enhancements to existing controls, systems and procedures to manage these risks."

          "text": "We are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including denial-of-service attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We have faced a high volume of cyber attacks as we expand our mobile- and other internet-based products and services, as well as our usage of mobile and cloud technologies, and as we provide these services to individual consumers. Further, the use of AI by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our third-party vendors and clients. The migration of our communication from devices we provide to employee-owned devices presents additional risks of cyber attacks, as do hybrid work arrangements. In addition, due to our interconnectivity with third-party vendors (and their respective service providers), central agents, exchanges, clearinghouses and other financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event. These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the third party subject to the cyber attack or other information security event or could result in unauthorized access to or disclosure of client, customer or other confidential information, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation."

          "text": "In the ordinary course of business, we are at times subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty, borrower, issuer (including sovereign issuers) or geographic area or group of related countries, such as the E.U., and a failure or downgrade of, or default by, such entity could negatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities, industries, countries and regions may not function as we have anticipated. Regulatory reform, including the Dodd-Frank Act, has led to increased centralization of trading activity through particular clearinghouses, central agents or exchanges, which has significantly increased our concentration of risk with respect to these entities. While our activities expose us to many different industries, counterparties and countries, we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties engaged in financial services activities, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, clearinghouses, exchanges and investment funds. This has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to these counterparties."
