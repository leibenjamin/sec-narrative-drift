The two companies share commercialization expenses and profit/losses equally on a global basis. In April 2015, we signed an agreement with BMS to transfer full commercialization rights in certain smaller markets to us, beginning in the third quarter of 2015. Xtandi is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Astellas. The two companies share equally in the gross profits (losses) related to U.S. net sales of Xtandi . Subject to certain exceptions, Pfizer and Astellas also share equally all Xtandi commercialization costs attributable to the U.S. market. Pfizer and Astellas also share certain development and other collaboration expenses and Pfizer receives tiered royalties as a percentage of international Xtandi net sales (recorded in Other (Income)/Deductions \u2013\u2013 Net).

Furthermore, although our shareholders will be entitled to elect to receive Allergan ordinary shares or cash consideration for their shares of our common stock, such elections will be subject to proration procedures set forth in the merger agreement, such that our existing shareholders will receive in the aggregate no less than $6 billion and no more than $12 billion in cash, and therefore our existing shareholders may receive a form of consideration different from what they elect."

Under this method, we will allocate the total purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Allergan based on their fair values as of the date of the completion of the proposed merger, and record any excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. For certain tangible and intangible assets, reevaluating fair value as of the completion date of the proposed merger will result in Pfizer incurring additional depreciation and/or amortization expense that exceed the combined amounts recorded by Pfizer and Allergan prior to the proposed merger. This increased expense will be recorded by us over the useful lives of the underlying assets. In addition, to the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets were to become impaired, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of those assets."

For additional information, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook\n\u2022 Our Business\n\u2022 Impact of Recent Hurricanes in Puerto Rico section of the 2017 Financial Report. We cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future; however, we have a program for reviewing our vulnerability to potential weather-related risks and we update our assessments periodically. To date, we have concluded that, because of our facility locations, our existing distribution networks and our controls, we do not anticipate that these risks will have a material impact on Pfizer in the near term."

          "text": "Under President Trump\u2019s administration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the ACA, although the current likelihood of repeal of the ACA appears low given the failure of the Senate\u2019s multiple attempts to repeal various combinations of ACA provisions. In October 2017, the President signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies to look for ways to authorize more health plans that could be less expensive because the plans would not have to meet all of the ACA\u2019s coverage requirements, and announced that his administration will withhold the cost-sharing subsidies paid to health insurance exchange plans serving low-income enrollees. In December 2017, the comprehensive tax reform package signed into law, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, includes a provision that effectively repealed the ACA\u2019s individual mandate by removing the penalties. These and similar actions by the administration are widely expected to lead to fewer Americans having comprehensive ACA-compliant health insurance, even in the absence of a full legislative repeal. The revenues generated for Pfizer by the health insurance exchanges under the ACA are minor, so the impact of the recent administration actions is expected to be limited. We also may face uncertainties if our industry is looked to for savings to fund certain legislation, such as lifting the debt ceiling. One recent example is the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which increased the discount we pay in the Medicare Part D coverage gap from 50% to 70%, which will modestly reduce our future Medicare Part D revenues."

Abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and, since the passage in 2010 of the ACA, a framework for such approval exists in the U.S. The regulatory implementation of these ACA provisions is ongoing, and, since 2015, the FDA approved a number of biosimilars, including Inflectra (infliximab-dyyb). Pfizer has exclusive commercialization rights to Inflectra from Celltrion Inc. and Celltrion Healthcare, Co., Ltd. (collectively, Celltrion) in the U.S., Canada and certain other territories.

We, for example, may fail to achieve cost savings anticipated with the acquisition of Hospira, or such cost savings within the expected time frame. Similarly, the accretive impact anticipated from the acquisitions of Hospira, Anacor and Medivation may not be realized or may be delayed. Integration of these businesses may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, including third-party relationships, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. We also may fail to generate the revenue growth for the acquired business that we expected at the time of entering into the transaction. Expected revenue from acquired products and product candidates also may be constrained by developments outside of our control. Unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from products and product candidates, including those acquired in these acquisitions. Hospira, for example, has experienced manufacturing disruptions and substantial regulatory scrutiny due to quality issues, including receiving a warning letter from the FDA in February 2017 communicating the FDA \u2019 s view that certain violations of cGMP regulations exist at Hospira \u2019 s manufacturing facility in McPherson, Kansas. Manufacturing problems, as well as any corrective actions and their operational implementation, could adversely impact the revenue we generate from products acquired from Hospira and result in substantial unanticipated costs. For additional information, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook \u2013\u2013 Our Business\n\u2022 Product Manufacturing section in our 2017 Financial Report.

Those products accounted for 49% of our total revenues in 2019 . If these products or any of our other major products were to become subject to problems such as loss of patent protection (if applicable), changes in prescription growth rates, material product liability litigation, unexpected side effects, regulatory proceedings, publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, pressure from existing competitive products, changes in labeling, pricing and access pressures, supply shortages or, if a new, more effective treatment should be introduced, the adverse impact on our revenues could be significant. A number of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and patents covering a number of our best-selling medicines are, or have been, the subject of pending legal challenges. For example, as a result of a patent litigation settlement, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. launched a generic version of Viagra (a product in our Upjohn business) in the U.S. in December 2017. In addition, Lyrica (a product in our Upjohn business) lost patent protection in the U.S. in June 2019 and multi-source generic competition began in July 2019. Also, the basic product patent for Chantix in the U.S. will expire in November 2020.

In August 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware decided that the two challenged Eliquis patents are both valid and infringed by the remaining generic companies.

The IRA includes several provisions to lower prescription drug costs for Medicare patients and to reduce drug spending by the federal government. Among other things, the IRA enhances the Medicare Part D benefit by eliminating the coverage gap (\u201cdonut hole\u201d) beginning in 2025, adds a maximum out-of-pocket cap for Medicare beneficiaries (set at $2,000 for 2025), and creates a new program that allows patients to pay their cost-sharing over time. The law also requires manufacturers to provide a 10% discount on branded prescriptions in the initial coverage phase and a 20% discount in the catastrophic phase, imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D on drug price increases that outpace inflation, and directs HHS to set the prices of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare (known as the \u201cMedicare Drug Price Negotiation Program\u201d). In August 2023, the Biden Administration published the first ten medicines subject to the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, which included Eliquis. As a selected drug, CMS will establish a \u201cmaximum fair price\u201d for Eliquis and that price will be published by September 1, 2024. The price will be in effect in 2026. The maximum fair price established by CMS is required to be offered to all Medicare beneficiaries and to covered entities participating in the 340B Program if that maximum fair price is lower than the discounted price such entities are offered under the 340B Program ceiling price calculation. In addition, there will be a new Medicare manufacturer discount program agreement expected to be signed in March 2024 that will change our discounting obligations for all medicines in Medicare, with few exceptions, beginning in 2025. The Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program is currently subject to legal challenges and therefore, the outcome of the Program remains uncertain. We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA on our business, operations and financial condition and results as the full effect of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain."

We expect to see continued focus by the U.S. Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating pricing and access to medicine. For example, in August 2022, the drug pricing provisions of the IRA were signed into law, which, among other things, require manufacturers of certain drugs, including Pfizer, to engage in price negotiations with Medicare which will permit the CMS to set a maximum fair price for selected drugs, impose rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation, and replace the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program. The drug pricing provisions of the IRA began to be implemented in 2022 and implementation efforts are expected to continue over the next several years.

          "text": "Third-party payers also use additional measures such as new-to-market blocks, exclusion lists, indication-based pricing and value-based pricing/contracting to improve their cost containment efforts. Such payers are also increasingly imposing utilization management tools, such as clinical protocols, requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine. As the U.S. private third-party payer market consolidates further and as more drugs become available in generic form, we may face greater pricing pressure from private third-party payers as they continue to drive more of their patients to use lower cost generic alternatives."

The negotiating power of MCOs and other private third-party payers has increased due to consolidation, and they, along with governments, increasingly employ formularies to control costs and encourage utilization of certain drugs, including through the use of formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. These initiatives have increased consumers\u2019 interest and input in medication choices, as they pay for a larger portion of their prescription costs and may cause them to favor lower-cost generic alternatives. We may fail to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our products, or fail to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing."

In 2022, we principally sold Paxlovid to government agencies. In the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines directly to the federal government, CDC, wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated delivery systems. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government institutions. Certain of these government contracts may be renegotiated or terminated at the discretion of a government entity. In addition, our contracts with government and supranational organizations for the sales of Comirnaty and Paxlovid, which are binding contracts, represented a significant amount of revenues in 2022. To date, we primarily sold Comirnaty and Paxlovid globally under government contracts. We expect sales of Comirnaty and Paxlovid in the U.S. will transition to commercial channels in the second half of 2023. We also seek to gain access for our products on formularies, which are lists of approved medicines available to members of healthcare programs or PBMs. PBMs use various benefit designs, such as tiered co-pays for formulary products, to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions. We may also work with payers on disease management programs that help to develop tools and materials to educate patients and physicians on key disease areas.
