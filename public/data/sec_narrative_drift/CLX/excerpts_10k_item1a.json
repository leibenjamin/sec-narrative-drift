However, alternative retail channels, including hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and subscription services, have become more prevalent and consumer products are increasingly being sold through such alternative retail channels. Although the Company is engaged in e-commerce with respect to many of its products, if we are not successful in expanding sales in such alternative retail channels, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted. In addition, the growth of the alternative retail channels that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell and selling predominantly \"private label\" products may reduce the Company's ability to market and sell its products through such retailers.

Most of the Company\u2019s products compete with other widely advertised brands within each product category. The Company also faces competition from retailers, including club stores, grocery stores, dollar stores, mass merchandisers, e-commerce retailers and subscription services, which are increasingly offering \u201cprivate label\u201d brands that are typically sold at lower prices and compete with the Company\u2019s products in certain categories. Increased purchases of \u201cprivate label\u201d products could reduce net sales of the Company\u2019s higher-margin products or there could be a shift in product mix to lower-margin offerings, which would negatively impact our margins."

While the Company has business continuity plans in place, if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, including catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches or other similar events, and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct business, which may adversely impact the Company's business. Furthermore, the Company sells its Burt's Bees\u00ae natural personal care products, Renew Life\u00ae digestive health products and other products directly to consumers online, provides websites, mobile apps and connected devices, and offers promotions, rebates, customer loyalty and other programs through which it may receive personal information, and it or its vendors could experience cyber-attacks, privacy breaches, data breaches or other incidents that result in unauthorized disclosure of consumer, customer, employee or Company information. In August 2015, the federal government brought an indictment against brokers and hackers for stealing advanced, nonpublic press releases of various public companies from news wires and trading on securities using the information from such press releases. If the Company suffers a loss as a result of a breach or other breakdown in its technology, including such cyber-attack, privacy breaches, data breaches or other incident involving one of the Company's vendors, that result in unauthorized disclosure or significant unavailability of business, financial, personal or stakeholder information, the Company may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm and may be exposed to legal liability, which may adversely affect the Company's results of operations and/or financial condition. In addition, if the Company's service providers, suppliers or customers experience such a breach or unauthorized disclosure or system failure, their businesses could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected, which may result in a disruption in the Company's supply chain or reduced customer orders, which would adversely affect the Company's business operations."

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the Company's financial statements would be prevented or detected. The Company's continuing growth and expansion in domestic and globally dispersed markets, such as its recent acquisition of Renew Life, may place significant additional pressure on the Company's system of internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, the Company engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes, which injects additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the Company's ability to report its financial results accurately and on a timely basis, or to detect and prevent fraud and could expose it to regulatory enforcement action and shareholder claims."

The Company cannot be certain that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. There is a risk that the Company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. The Company cannot be certain that these rights, if obtained, will not later be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, and the Company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert its intellectual property rights or to defend those rights from assertions of invalidity. In addition, even if such rights are obtained in the United States, the laws of some of the other countries in which the Company's products are or may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If other parties infringe the Company's intellectual property rights, they may dilute or diminish the value of the Company's brands and products in the marketplace, which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the Company's brands and harm its net sales. The failure to perfect and protect its intellectual property rights could make the Company less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, and financial condition."

The Tax Act, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including a reduction of the U.S. corporation statutory income tax rate to 21% from 35%, one-time taxation of accumulated foreign earnings regardless of whether they are repatriated, limitations on the deduction for interest expense, immediate tax deductions for five years for new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, disallowance of deductions for certain-performance based compensation, elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities and a migration from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a modified territorial system. Although we continue to assess and analyze the full effects of the Tax Act on our business and the Company, we expect the Tax Act, as a whole, will reduce our effective tax rate in future periods, in addition to fiscal year 2018. In addition, although we expect a positive impact to our cash flows from the Tax Act, such impact will be realized in future periods as we realize the benefit from the lower effective tax rates."

It is not clear when, or whether, Congress may address any of these issues or when the Internal Revenue Service may issue additional administrative guidance on the changes made in the Tax Act. In addition, the FASB provided guidance intended to clarify the accounting for certain aspects of the Tax Act. Furthermore, foreign countries may decide to enact tax laws that may negatively affect our foreign tax liabilities in retaliation for any real or perceived negative effects of the Tax Act on their countries that they deem unfair or for other reasons and/or states or local government may decide to enact tax laws that may increase tax liabilities for companies doing business in such jurisdictions as they see opportunities to increase state and local corporate taxes after the federal corporate tax rate was reduced by the Tax Act."

In addition, the Company is subject to laws of various countries where it operates or does business related to solicitation, collection, processing or use of consumer, customer, vendor or employee information or related data. Furthermore, pending legislative initiatives and adopted legislation in the areas of healthcare reform and other areas, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and legislation in the area of taxation of domestic and foreign profits, executive compensation and corporate governance, could also increase the Company\u2019s costs.

The Company devotes significant time and resources to programs that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to protect and preserve the Company\u2019s reputation and the reputation of its brands and products. These programs include ethics and compliance, the setting of sustainability goals and product safety and quality initiatives. Despite these efforts, negative publicity about the Company, including product safety, quality, efficacy, environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use and waste management) and other sustainability or similar issues, whether real or perceived, could occur. In addition, the Company\u2019s products could face withdrawal, recall, other quality issues or decreased demand. In particular, the Company\u2019s dietary supplement and related products are highly dependent on consumers\u2019 perception of the efficacy, safety and quality of our products, as well as similar products distributed by other companies, and may be supported by only a limited number of conclusive clinical studies. Newly published clinical studies and emerging studies could prove or allege that ingredients in our dietary supplement products or the products themselves (or similar products of other companies) are ineffective or harmful to consumers. The Company also licenses certain of its brands to third parties, which creates additional exposure for those brands to product safety, quality, sustainability and other concerns. In addition, widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility and speed of dissemination of information. Negative publicity, posts or comments by consumers or competitors about the Company, its brands, its products, its marketing activities or its employees, whether accurate or inaccurate, or disclosure of non-public sensitive information about the Company, could be widely disseminated through the use of social media or network sites or through other media or in other formats.

Loss of or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations, particularly with respect to its charcoal business, could delay or prevent the Company from meeting current product demand, introducing new products, building new facilities or acquiring new businesses and could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, as a result of the Company\u2019s acquisition of RenewLife and Nutranext, it markets and sells products that are subject to regulations relating to dietary supplements. In order to comply with any changes in these laws and regulations, including any changes that result from newly published clinical studies and emerging studies that may assert or prove that ingredients in our products or our products themselves are ineffective or harmful to consumers, the Company may be required to make changes to product formulation, labeling or marketing claims, perform additional testing to substantiate its product claims, make costly changes in its manufacturing processes or supply chain or stop selling certain products until corrective actions have been taken.

These competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the Company can. In addition, as the Company currently experiences increased demand for many of its products, especially its disinfecting products, in response to COVID-19, it expects heightened competitive activity from strong local competitors, other large multinational companies, and new entrants into the market in many of its categories, especially the disinfecting category. The Company expects such activities to include more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, increased promotional spending and geographic expansion, and marketing of new disinfecting products. It expects promotional activities to increase as retailers try aggressively to get consumers back into their stores after prolonged \u201cstay at home\u201d and other government restrictions continue to ease over the coming months. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by the Company. Competitive activity may require the Company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions and/or reduce prices, which could lead to reduced sales, margins and/or net earnings."

This has caused strain on the Company\u2019s supply chain network and its ability to meet such demand, especially with respect to its disinfecting products, due to, among other things, the loss or disruption to the timely availability of adequate supplies of raw materials and finished goods that the Company requires for the manufacture of its products, disruptions in transportation and logistics operations, and shortage, restriction or disruption in its manufacturing and distribution capacity. The Company\u2019s inability to fully or substantially meet such demand could result in, among other things, shortages in the Company's products, unmet consumer demand leading to reduced preference for the Company\u2019s products in the future, customers purchasing products from the Company\u2019s competitors as a result of such shortage of products, strained customer relationships, termination of customer contracts, additional competition and new entrants into the market, and loss of potential sales and revenue, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations."

The Tax Act, among other things, significantly changed corporate taxation, including by reducing the U.S. corporation statutory income tax rate to 21% from 35%, imposing a one-time taxation of accumulated foreign earnings regardless of whether they are repatriated, placing limitations on the deduction for interest expense, creating immediate tax deductions until January 1, 2023 for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, disallowing deductions for certain performance-based compensation, eliminating the deduction for certain domestic production activities and migrating from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a modified territorial system.

Moreover, the Company engages the services of third parties to assist with business operations and financial reporting processes, which injects additional monitoring obligations and risk into the system of internal control.

In order to comply with any changes in these laws and regulations, including any changes that result from newly published clinical studies and emerging studies that may assert or prove that ingredients in our products or our products themselves are ineffective or harmful to consumers, the Company may be required to make changes to product formulation, labeling or marketing claims, perform additional testing to substantiate its product claims, make costly changes in its manufacturing processes or supply chain or stop selling certain products until corrective actions have been taken.

In addition, on December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), ceased publishing certain LIBOR reference rates. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate derived from the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), which is a relatively new reference rate and has a very limited history. The future performance of SOFR cannot be predicted based on its limited historical performance. Since the initial publication of SOFR in April 2018, changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than changes in other benchmark or market rates, such as United States dollar LIBOR. Additionally, any successor rate to SOFR under our revolving credit facility may not have the same"

The Company is subject to the laws and regulations of various countries where it operates or does business related to solicitation, collection, processing, transferring, storing or use of consumer, customer, vendor or employee information or related data, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020. These laws and regulations change frequently, and new legislation continues to be introduced and may be interpreted and applied differently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. For example, the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), which was effective on January 1, 2022, modifies the CCPA significantly. Several other states have introduced or passed similar legislation to the CCPA and CPRA, which may impose varying standards and requirements on our data collection, use and processing activities. The changes introduced by data privacy and protection regulations increase the complexity of regulations enacted to protect business and personal data and they subject the Company to additional costs and have required, and may in the future require, costly changes to the Company\u2019s security systems, policies, procedures and practices. These laws and regulations also may result in the Company incurring additional expenses and liabilities in the event of unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal data."

The Company devotes significant time and resources to training programs, relating to, among other things, ethics, compliance and product safety and quality, as well as sustainability goals, and has published ESG goals, including relating to environmental impact and sustainability and inclusion and diversity, as part of its IGNITE Strategy. Despite these efforts or if the Company is not successful in achieving its goals, provides materially inaccurate information, or receives negative publicity about the Company, including relating to product safety, quality, efficacy, ESG or similar issues, whether real or perceived, could occur. In addition, the Company\u2019s products could face withdrawal, recall or other quality issues, which could lead to decreased demand for and reputational damage to the related brands. In particular, the Company\u2019s dietary supplement and related products are highly dependent on consumers\u2019 perception of the efficacy, safety and quality of our products, and may be supported by only a limited number of conclusive clinical studies. Newly published clinical studies and emerging studies could prove or allege that ingredients in our dietary supplement products or the products themselves (or similar products of other companies) are ineffective or harmful to consumers. The Company also licenses certain of its brands to third parties, and, with the increase in demand for public disinfecting and cleaning products due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has increased and may continue to increase its focus on partnering with, or licensing its intellectual property to, companies in industries involving shared space, and may partner with other companies, to provide disinfecting products and cleaning education and protocols, and to leverage its related brands. Such licenses and partnerships may create additional exposure for those brands to product safety, quality, sustainability and other concerns."

A divestiture could affect the profitability of the Company as a result of the gains or losses on such sale of a business or brand, the loss of the operating income or sales resulting from such sale or the costs or liabilities that are not assumed by the acquirer that may negatively impact profitability and cash flow subsequent to any divestiture. If the Company is unable to complete a divestiture or successfully transition a divested business, including the effective management of the related separation and overhead costs, transition services, and the maintenance of relationships with customers, suppliers, and other business partners, its business and financial results could be negatively impacted. The Company may also be required to recognize impairment charges or other losses as a result of a divestiture. For example, in March 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Argentina business, which consisted of two production plants in Argentina as well as the rights to the Company\u2019s brands in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, and in July 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Better Health VMS business. The Better Health VMS transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. As a result of these transactions, the Company recorded a loss for the sale of its Argentina business in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 and expects to record a loss for the sale of its Better Health VMS business during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025."
