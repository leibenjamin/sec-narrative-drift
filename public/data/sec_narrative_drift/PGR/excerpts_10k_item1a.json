We are undergoing a multi-year financial enterprise resource planning effort to modernize certain of our financial systems and processes. In conjunction with this effort, we are expecting to implement changes to our monthly financial closing processes, including changes to our accounting calendar, in the fourth quarter of 2023. Our current financial closing calendar, which generally consists of a 52-week year, with 13-week quarters, and months within each quarter consisting of one 5-week and two 4-week months, will be converted to align with a traditional Gregorian calendar (e.g., January-31 days, February-28/29 days, March-31 days). We do not expect that these changes will have a material impact on our reported quarterly and annual results, but they may impact year-over-year comparisons of monthly results during the first twelve months after the changes are implemented. As a result, during this period, we expect to modify and limit the content, and potentially the timing and frequency, of public disclosures of our monthly results relative to our historical practice, which could cause additional volatility in our stock price."

We review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually. Valuing these assets, and evaluating their recoverability, requires us to make estimates and assumptions related to future returns on equity, margins, growth rates, discount rates, and other matters, and our estimates may change over time, potentially resulting in asset write-downs. Goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges could result from declines in operating results, divestitures, or sustained market declines, among other factors, and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which they are recognized."

Additionally, it is likely that we will be subject to new AI-focused regulations that could impose varied compliance and reporting requirements and challenges that could impact our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. For example, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted guiding principles on AI, as well as a model bulletin, to inform and articulate general expectations for businesses, professionals, and stakeholders across the insurance industry as they implement AI tools to facilitate operations. Alaska recently adopted the NAIC model bulletin and, while the model bulletin is only effective as adopted by each specific state, we expect these guidelines to be adopted by at least some additional states. In addition, regulators have recently requested information from insurers on their use of algorithms and AI. Colorado issued a first-in-the-nation AI governance regulation for life (and soon auto) insurers related to its SB 169 law, addressing the use of AI models and external consumer data in AI models. The regulation also describes compliance documentation to be submitted to the Colorado Division of Insurance on a regular basis. We cannot predict what other regulatory actions may be taken with regard to AI but any limitations, or any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any such requirements, could have an adverse impact on our business."

          "text": "We have developed, and used for many years, new technologies, including machine learning, predictive models, algorithms, automated processes, and other forms of traditional artificial intelligence (AI), and will in the future develop and use AI and other new technologies in our business. As with many technological innovations, the growing development and use of generative AI (GenAI) presents additional risks that may adversely affect our business. GenAI might produce or reveal datasets that are flawed or insufficient or contain biased information, which could result in unintentionally and unfairly discriminatory outcomes in our business processes. These deficiencies could also undermine the associated predictions, analysis, or decisions GenAI applications produce or the business decisions we make based on this information. We could face challenges on whether we use GenAI in our business processes in a responsible, compliant, and effective manner. Since GenAI is subject to public debate, and depending on how observers view our development and use of GenAI, we could be subject to criticism or experience an adverse impact on our brand or reputation, which could decrease demand for our products or services, create difficulties in our ability to recruit and retain employees, negatively impact our stock price, and lead to greater regulatory scrutiny of our businesses. Additionally, one or more of our key vendors may begin to use GenAI in their business in a manner that does not meet existing or rapidly evolving regulatory standards. Furthermore, our competitors or other third parties may be able to incorporate GenAI into their products more quickly, or more successfully, than us."

We, and certain of our third-party vendors, have experienced attacks and incidents in the past, and there can be no assurance that we, or any vendor, will be successful in preventing future attacks or incidents or detecting and stopping them once they have begun. Cybersecurity risks rapidly evolve and are complex, so we must continually adapt and enhance our processes and technological defenses. As we do this, we must make judgments about where to invest resources to most effectively protect ourselves from cybersecurity risks. These are inherently challenging judgements and we can provide no assurance that processes and technological defenses that we implement will be effective."

The retention threshold for the BOP and Progressive high-limits auto liability excess of loss agreements is $1 million, for each casualty occurrence or each property loss. For the Protective Insurance large fleet commercial auto business, we retain the first $2 million, per occurrence, and have coverage excess of $2 million up to $5 million. Under the current program, in certain scenarios, our retention could be reduced to $1 million, depending on the accumulation of losses in excess of $1 million. In addition, for the workers\u2019 compensation product, we have catastrophe workers\u2019 compensation coverage up to $75 million per occurrence pursuant to a $20 million maximum any one life sublimit. In general, we retain approximately $1.4 million per occurrence on workers\u2019 compensation through the use of excess of loss and quota-share reinsurance."

          "text": "Insurance departments establish and monitor compliance with capital and surplus requirements. Although the ratio of written premiums to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors (including applicable law, the type of business being written, the adequacy of the insurer\u2019s reserves, and the quality of the insurer\u2019s assets), the annual net premiums that an insurer may write historically have been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer\u2019s total surplus, generally 3 to 1 for property and casualty insurance, which is the target for our vehicle businesses; our Property business maintains a lower premiums-to-surplus ratio. Thus, the amount of an insurer\u2019s statutory surplus, in certain cases, may limit its ability to grow its business. At year-end 2022, we had net premiums written of $51.1 billion and statutory surplus of $17.9 billion. The combined premiums-to-surplus ratio for all of our insurance companies was 2.9 to 1. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we had access to $4.4 billion of securities held in a non-insurance subsidiary, portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth or for other purposes."
