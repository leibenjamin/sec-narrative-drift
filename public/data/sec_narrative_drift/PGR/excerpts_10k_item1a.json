Our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return through the realization of tax credits and, in some cases, through other tax benefits and cash flows from the project. Certain of these investments are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits can be challenged or are subject to recapture by the applicable taxing authorities if specific requirements are not satisfied. Many of the factors that could lead to a challenge or recapture of tax credits are beyond our control. The inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition."

We also use reinsurance contracts to reinsure portions of our Commercial Lines and umbrella insurance businesses. Reinsurance arrangements are often subject to a threshold below which reinsurance does not apply, so that we are responsible for all losses below the threshold from a covered event, and to an aggregate dollar coverage limit, so that our claims liabilities arising from a covered event may exceed our reinsurance coverage. In addition, although the reinsurer is liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage, the original insurer remains liable under the policies to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. As a result, we are subject to the risk that reinsurers will be unable to pay, or will dispute, reinsurance claims. Further, the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance market conditions (which can be impacted by the occurrence of significant reinsured events). We may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all. The availability and cost of reinsurance could adversely affect our business volume, profitability, or financial condition."

At the time of the ARX acquisition, we recorded goodwill and intangible assets at fair value. Goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, while other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Valuing these assets, and evaluating their recoverability, requires us to make estimates and assumptions related to future returns on equity, margins, growth rates, discount rates, and other matters, and our estimates may change over time, potentially resulting in write-downs of the assets. Goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges could result from declines in operating results, divestitures or sustained market declines, among other factors, and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which they are recognized."

If our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices, offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer, are permitted to offer their products under different legal and regulatory constraints than those that apply to us, or engage in other successful competitive initiatives, our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be compromised. In addition, because auto insurance constitutes a significant portion of our overall business, we may be more sensitive than other insurers to, and more adversely affected by, trends that could decrease auto insurance rates or reduce demand for auto insurance over time, such as advances in autonomous vehicles and vehicle sharing arrangements."

Our current financial closing calendar, which generally consists of a 52-week year, with 13-week quarters, and months within each quarter consisting of one 5-week and two 4-week months, will be converted to align with a traditional Gregorian calendar (e.g., January-31 days, February-28/29 days, March-31 days). We do not expect that these changes will have a material impact on our reported quarterly and annual results, but they may impact year-over-year comparisons of monthly results during the first twelve months after the changes are implemented. As a result, during this period, we expect to modify and limit the content, and potentially the timing and frequency, of public disclosures of our monthly results relative to our historical practice, which could cause additional volatility in our stock price."

Additionally, it is likely that we will be subject to new AI-focused regulations that could impose varied compliance and reporting requirements and challenges that could impact our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. For example, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted guiding principles on AI, as well as a model bulletin, to inform and articulate general expectations for businesses, professionals, and stakeholders across the insurance industry as they implement AI tools to facilitate operations. Alaska recently adopted the NAIC model bulletin and, while the model bulletin is only effective as adopted by each specific state, we expect these guidelines to be adopted by at least some additional states. In addition, regulators have recently requested information from insurers on their use of algorithms and AI. Colorado issued a first-in-the-nation AI governance regulation for life (and soon auto) insurers related to its SB 169 law, addressing the use of AI models and external consumer data in AI models. The regulation also describes compliance documentation to be submitted to the Colorado Division of Insurance on a regular basis. We cannot predict what other regulatory actions may be taken with regard to AI but any limitations, or any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any such requirements, could have an adverse impact on our business."

GenAI might produce or reveal datasets that are flawed or insufficient or contain biased information, which could result in unintentionally and unfairly discriminatory outcomes in our business processes. These deficiencies could also undermine the associated predictions, analysis, or decisions GenAI applications produce or the business decisions we make based on this information. We could face challenges on whether we use GenAI in our business processes in a responsible, compliant, and effective manner. Since GenAI is subject to public debate, and depending on how observers view our development and use of GenAI, we could be subject to criticism or experience an adverse impact on our brand or reputation, which could decrease demand for our products or services, create difficulties in our ability to recruit and retain employees, negatively impact our stock price, and lead to greater regulatory scrutiny of our businesses. Additionally, one or more of our key vendors may begin to use GenAI in their business in a manner that does not meet existing or rapidly evolving regulatory standards. Furthermore, our competitors or other third parties may be able to incorporate GenAI into their products more quickly, or more successfully, than us."

Additionally, we are subject to new AI-focused regulations and regulatory expectations that could impose varied compliance and reporting requirements and challenges that could impact our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. For example, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted guiding principles on AI, as well as a model bulletin, to inform and articulate general expectations for businesses, professionals, and stakeholders across the insurance industry as they implement AI tools to facilitate operations. Nearly half of all departments of insurance have adopted the NAIC AI model bulletin. Other states have adopted or are considering alternatives, including comprehensive AI legislation or reminders that existing state laws pertain to AI activities, including laws regarding unfair claims and trade practices. We cannot predict what other regulatory actions may be taken with regard to AI but any limitations, or any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any such requirements, could have an adverse impact on our business."

In addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen. In addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations, adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen, and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand, potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us. Therefore, the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyberattack, if sufficiently severe, could have a material adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity."

All of these systems are subject to \u201ccyberattacks\u201d by third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities, which are becoming more frequent and more sophisticated, and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees, consultants, agents, and other persons with legitimate access to our systems.

          "text": "We currently report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis. We undertook a multi-year financial enterprise resource planning effort to modernize certain of our financial systems and processes. In conjunction with this effort, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we converted our monthly accounting closing calendar to align with the Gregorian calendar (e.g., January-31 days, February-28/29 days, March-31 days). We do not expect that these changes will have a material impact on our reported quarterly and annual results, but they may impact year-over-year comparisons of monthly results from October 2023 through September 2024. As a result, during this period, we will modify and limit the content, and potentially the timing, of public disclosures of our monthly results relative to our historical practice, which could cause additional volatility in our stock price."

For example, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has adopted guiding principles on AI, as well as a model bulletin, to inform and articulate general expectations for businesses, professionals, and stakeholders across the insurance industry as they implement AI tools to facilitate operations. Alaska recently adopted the NAIC model bulletin and, while the model bulletin is only effective as adopted by each specific state, we expect these guidelines to be adopted by at least some additional states. In addition, regulators have recently requested information from insurers on their use of algorithms and AI. Colorado issued a first-in-the-nation AI governance regulation for life (and soon auto) insurers related to its SB 169 law, addressing the use of AI models and external consumer data in AI models. The regulation also describes compliance documentation to be submitted to the Colorado Division of Insurance on a regular basis. We cannot predict what other regulatory actions may be taken with regard to AI but any limitations, or any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any such requirements, could have an adverse impact on our business."
