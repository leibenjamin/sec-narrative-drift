These expenditures are generally dependent on our customers\u2019 views of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to our customers\u2019 views of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Since 2014, oil and gas prices have declined significantly, resulting in lower expenditures by our customers. As a result, many of our customers have reduced or delayed their oil and gas exploration and production spending, reducing the demand for our products and services and exerting downward pressure on the prices that we charge. These conditions have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial condition."

On December 17, 2015, Cameron stockholders voted to adopt our proposed merger. Also, in November 2015 the U.S. Department of Justice cleared our proposed merger without any conditions. However, we will be unable to complete the merger until consents and approvals are received from the European Commission and various other governmental entities. Regulatory entities have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations and may impose certain requirements or obligations as conditions for their approval. The merger agreement may require us to accept conditions from these regulators that could adversely affect the combined company. If the regulatory clearances are not received, or they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, then we will not be obligated to complete the merger. We can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the necessary approvals will be obtained, or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined company following the merger. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the merger."

These lawsuits were consolidated for all purposes and a consolidated amended class action complaint (the \u201cConsolidated Complaint\u201d) was filed. The Consolidated Complaint seeks various remedies, including enjoining the merger from being consummated, rescission of the merger to the extent already implemented and the plaintiffs\u2019 costs and fees. Additional lawsuits with similar allegations may be filed. While we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against such claims, the outcome of any such litigation is inherently uncertain. One of the conditions to the closing of the merger is that no law, order, injunction, judgment, decree, ruling or other similar requirement shall be in effect that prohibits the completion of the merger. Accordingly, if any of the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the completion of the merger, then that injunction may prevent the merger from becoming effective, or delay its becoming effective."

One non-US subsidiary also maintains an account at Tejarat for payment of local expenses such as taxes and utilities.

If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected."

These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change, have tended to become more stringent over time, and could conflict among one another. In the event the scope of these laws and regulations expands in the future, the incremental cost of compliance could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows."

          "text": "Public health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have caused, and could again cause, a significant reduction in global economic activity, significantly weakening demand for oil and gas, and in turn, demand for our products and services. Other effects of public health emergencies have included, and may continue to include, significant volatility and disruption of the global financial markets; adverse revenue and net income effects; disruptions to our operations, including suspension or deferral of drilling activities; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production; downward revisions to customer budgets; limitations on access to sources of liquidity; supply chain disruptions; limitations on access to raw materials; employee impacts from illness; and local and regional closures or lockdowns, including temporary closures of our facilities and the facilities of our customers and suppliers. The extent to which our operating and financial results will be and may continue to be affected by public health emergencies will depend on various factors beyond our control, such as the continued severity and duration of the public health emergencies, including any sustained geographic resurgence; the emergence of new variants and strains of a contagious disease or virus; and the success of actions to contain or mitigate the effects of the public health emergency. A public health emergency, and volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from a public health emergency, could also aggravate our other risk factors described in this Form 10-K."

          "text": "Our digital technologies and services, as well as third-party products, services and technologies that we rely on (including emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence programs), are subject to the risk of cyberattacks and, given the nature of such attacks, some incidents can remain undetected for a period of time despite efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner. Cyberattacks are expected to accelerate on a global basis in both frequency and magnitude as threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in using techniques and tools (including artificial intelligence) that circumvent controls, evade detection and even remove forensic evidence of the infiltration. There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect material consequences arising from such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur. We have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal conduct of our business, including attacks resulting from social engineering such as phishing and ransomware infections. Even if we successfully defend our own digital technologies and services, we also rely on providers of third-party products, services, and networks, with whom we may share data and services, and who may be unable to effectively defend their digital technologies and services against attack."
