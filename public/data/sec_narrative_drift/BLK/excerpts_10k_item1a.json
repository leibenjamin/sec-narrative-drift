If \u201cvalue\u201d has not been provided to consumers, the Company will need to address any identified deficiencies. The FCA also requested that the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (\u201cCMA\u201d) assess the investment consultant and fiduciary markets. The CMA\u2019s final report identified a number of competition issues in such markets and it will consider various remedies in 2019, including mandatory tendering of investment consultancy and fiduciary management services, and standards of disclosure of fees and performance. The CMA\u2019s remedies could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to enter into fiduciary and investment management mandates with UK pension fund clients."

The substantive provisions of the rule began to apply in June 2017.

If the DoL does not repeal or revise the rule or revise the prohibited transaction exemptions, the rule could require BlackRock to revise a number of its distribution relationships, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock\u2019s distribution partners and may limit BlackRock\u2019s ability to provide certain useful services and education to its clients."

          "text": "BlackRock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, access new clients, leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies. Inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, making minority investments in early- to mid-stage technological and other ventures and acquiring investment management and technology businesses. Inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases the assumption of pre-existing liabilities, which must be managed in order for BlackRock to realize the benefit of such transactions. The success of BlackRock\u2019s inorganic strategy also depends in large part on its ability to integrate the workforce, operations, strategies, technologies and other components of a target business following the completion of an acquisition. BlackRock may be required to commit significant management time, as well as create new, or grow existing, operational and support functions, to facilitate the integration of acquired businesses, manage combined future growth and maintain a cohesive corporate culture. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, retain associated talent, scale support functions or realize other intended benefits of its inorganic strategy. Moreover, the challenges associated with BlackRock\u2019s inorganic strategy may be heightened when acquired businesses are in new geographic locations, involve new markets, products or business lines or are delivered via technology that differs from that employed by BlackRock. Any failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with acquisitions through due diligence, indemnification provisions and/or operational expertise, or to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively, could have an adverse effect on BlackRock\u2019s reputation or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, which may harm the Company\u2019s competitive position in the investment management industry."

In July 2014, the FSOC pivoted from its previous entity-specific approach to designation and indicated that it would focus on a products and activities-based approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management. In December 2019, the FSOC re-affirmed this approach when it voted to change its methodology for assessing financial stability to a products and activities-based approach. This reduces the risk of an entity-level designation, however the FSOC retains the authority to designate an entity if an activities-based approach does not adequately address potential risks. In the event that BlackRock is designated as a SIFI under Dodd-Frank, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve."

The proposals would: (i) require that investors aggregate holdings in an issuer across all associated funds when assessing HSR filing and exemption thresholds and (ii) create a new exemption for acquisitions resulting in aggregate holdings of up to 10% of an issuer, which would be unavailable to investors holding interests of more than 1% in competing firms. If enacted as drafted, the proposal requiring aggregation across associated funds could, absent exemptions for index-funds or certain types of registered funds, substantially increase BlackRock\u2019s pre-merger notification obligations, which may be costly, impair funds\u2019 ability to trade freely, require the implementation of monitoring tools and introduce additional compliance burdens for both BlackRock and the companies in which it invests.

The SFTR aims to improve the transparency surrounding securities financing transactions and total return swaps by, among other things, requiring reporting of securities financing transactions to a trade repository and requiring disclosure of the use of securities financing transactions and total return swaps to investors. During 2020, additional obligations became effective under the SFTR that require BlackRock to submit additional transaction reports with substantive details of trading activity to authorities. Compliance with the SFTR may subject BlackRock to additional expenses and could lead to modifications in BlackRock\u2019s securities financing transaction activities."

AI methods are complex and rapidly evolving, and the introduction of AI into new or existing processes may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, IP or other litigation, data protection, confidentiality or information security risks, social or ethical concerns, competitive harm or other complications. For example, the use of datasets to develop and test AI models, the content generated by AI systems, or the application of AI systems may be found to be insufficient, biased or harmful, or lead to adverse business decisions or operating errors. AI technologies, including generative AI, may create content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate or flawed. In addition, IP ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI technologies have not been fully addressed by US courts or federal, state or non-US laws or regulation. Furthermore, regulation of AI technologies is evolving globally. Efforts around use of these technologies require additional investment in operational controls and procedures, development and implementation of appropriate protections and safeguards for handling the use of data with AI, including with respect to data leakage, and regulatory compliance costs. Any failure to successfully integrate AI technologies, respond to client or market demands or effectively manage the related risks could harm BlackRock\u2019s growth and reputation, adversely impact product offerings, client interactions or business initiatives, and expose the Company to legal and regulatory liabilities and additional costs, including regulatory fines or sanctions, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline."

Borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower\u2019s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan. BlackRock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities out on loan which mitigates the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered.

          "text": "\u2022\nSEC Rules on Private Fund Advisers\n: In 2023, the SEC adopted new rules and amendments to enhance regulation of private fund advisors. These included amendments to Form PF for registered investment advisers requiring new disclosures, filing obligations and enhanced reporting. The SEC adopted additional rules requiring registered private fund advisers to, among other things, provide quarterly reports to fund investors, obtain annual audits for funds, distribute fairness opinions in connection with certain transactions, prohibit certain types of preferential terms and treatment, and provide transparency to investors of all types of preferential treatment granted to other investors in the same fund. Implementing these rules and amendments may significantly increase BlackRock\u2019s reporting, disclosure and compliance obligations and create operational complexity for BlackRock\u2019s alternatives products."
