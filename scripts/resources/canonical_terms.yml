principles:
  - "Keep concepts small and defensible; prefer lexical variants over semantic synonymy."
  - "No overlap across concepts (v1): the same normalized variant must not appear in multiple concepts."
  - "Do not merge broad concepts (e.g., keep COVID-19 vs pandemic vs coronavirus distinct)."
