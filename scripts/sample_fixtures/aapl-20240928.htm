    <p>ITEM 1. BUSINESS</p>
    <p>
      We design, manufacture, and market a portfolio of consumer devices and
      services across multiple regions and sales channels.
    </p>
    <h2>ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS</h2>
    <p>
      Our business depends on a complex global supply chain that relies on
      third-party manufacturing partners and logistics providers. Disruptions
      from geopolitical events, labor constraints, or transportation delays can
      reduce product availability, increase costs, and impact our ability to
      meet demand. These risk factors can pressure margins and delay product
      launches across multiple regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Demand for our devices and services can shift quickly due to competitive
      offerings, pricing pressure, or changes in customer preferences. If we do
      not anticipate these changes, inventory levels may rise and promotional
      activity could increase. Risk factors also include regulatory scrutiny and
      changes in privacy expectations that may require product or platform
      adjustments.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rely on third-party components and software to deliver key features,
      and security vulnerabilities in those components could harm our products
      and services. Cybersecurity incidents, including data breaches or service
      outages, could result in reputational harm, litigation, and significant
      remediation costs. These risk factors may also affect the trust of
      customers and partners.
