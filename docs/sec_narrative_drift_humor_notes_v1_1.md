# SEC Narrative Drift — Humor Notes (Single Tone) (v1.1)

**Goal:** Add delight without undercutting credibility. Humor is microcopy that lowers friction.

## Rules (so it never feels tryhard)
- No settings toggle. One public tone only.
- Humor must be:
  - short
  - dry
  - functionally instructional
- Avoid:
  - jokes about fraud, “the SEC is fake”, dunking on compliance, or investment advice vibes
  - profanity or edgy sarcasm
  - “lol random” surrealism

## “Always-hit” placements (so most users see 1–3 lines)
1) **Home footnote** (near CTA): `Featured companies are precomputed, because live demos are a form of optimism.`
2) **Drift helper** (above fold): `Not a verdict — just where to read.`
3) **Heatmap helper** (common interaction): `It will not file a 10‑K for you.`

## Secondary placements (nice-to-have)
- Compare pane helper: `The receipts — curated, not comprehensive.`
- Data quality helper: `Low confidence years are where HTML and reality briefly disagree.`
- Callout label: `Most templated year` (dry corporate-speak)

## Reserve lines (unused for now)
Keep these in docs as backup; do not ship all at once:
- `A chart is not a thesis.`
- `We measure text. Reality is outside the scope of this dashboard.`
- `The metric is descriptive. Your interpretation is the product.`
- `If you’re looking for causality, you want a different app.`
- `This is not a scandal detector. It’s a change detector.`

## Reserve epigraphs (methodology-only, short, credited)
- Ferris: `In fact there was no such thing as a rumor. There was fact, and there was what did not come up in conversation.`
- Eggers: `Think of how much more genuine and authentic our friendships could be, if we just apply the right metrics to them.`
- Barry: `That's the thing you learn about values: they're what people make up to justify what they did.`
